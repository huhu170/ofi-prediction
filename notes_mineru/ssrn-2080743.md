### E4
- 证据类型：方法

- 原文关键句："White’s (2000) Reality Check can be applied to test the profitability of the best trading rule... gives an estimate of the true and nominal p-values by bootstrapping"

### E5

- 原文关键句："the results from the Reality Check and the Superior Predictive Ability tests indicate that the returns generated from the best rules are not large enough to beat the buy-and-hold strategy"

## 3）主题笔记（Topic Notes）
### OFI and OBIB Definitions for Short-Term Prediction
依据证据E2、E3：OFIB# is the count of buyer-initiated minus seller-initiated trades over a 5-minute interval; OFIB¥ is the Yen amount of buyer minus seller trades. OBIB is the difference between buy depth and sell depth at the end of the interval. These features are used to generate buy/sell signals for short-term (5-minute) trading.

### Predictability of Short-Term Returns Using Imbalances
依据证据E1：Over half of Nikkei225 stocks have 5-minute mid-quote returns predictable by OFIB#、OFIB¥、or OBIB. Larger firms show higher predictability rates (70% for largest vs.55% for smallest firms), suggesting institutional herding or order splitting effects influence return dynamics.

### Profitability of Imbalance-Based Technical Strategies
依据证据E5、E7：Imbalance-based rules (e.g., buy when OFIB# is positive by a threshold α) generate positive returns but not significantly higher than buy-and-hold after adjusting for data snooping (via White's Reality Check and Hansen's SPA). Transaction costs from bid-ask spreads further erode profits, making these strategies unprofitable.

### Risks in Limit Order Strategies Using OBIB
依据证据E8：Passive limit order strategies (based on OBIB) face two key risks: non-execution (orders not filled due to price priority) and picking-off (orders executed at unfavorable prices after market moves). These risks are large enough to make limit order trading unprofitable compared to the buy-and-hold strategy.


## 4）可直接写进论文的句子草稿（可选）
1. Order-flow imbalance (OFIB# and OFIB¥) and order-book imbalance (OBIB) are core features for predicting short-term (5-minute) returns of individual stocks in order-driven markets (依据证据E2、E3).
2. For over half of Nikkei225 stocks, past imbalances (OFIB#、OFIB¥、OBIB) predict 5-minute mid-quote returns, with larger firms exhibiting higher predictability rates (依据证据E1).
3. Imbalance-based technical rules generate positive returns but fail to outperform the buy-and-hold strategy after accounting for data snooping biases (依据证据E5).
4. Transaction costs from bid-ask spreads further reduce the profitability of technical strategies, making them even less competitive against passive buy-and-hold (依据证据E7).
5. Limit order strategies using order-book imbalance (OBIB) face significant non-execution and picking-off risks, which are major barriers to their profitability (依据证据E8).
