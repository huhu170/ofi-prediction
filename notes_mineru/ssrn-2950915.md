- 证据等级：A

### E3
- 证据类型：Result
- 定位信息：Section V, Tables9&10
- 原文关键句："A EUR100 million transaction is associated with a rise in bid-ask spreads between4 and8 basis points... depth falls by between EUR1.3 million and EUR1.6 million per EUR100 million purchased."
- 我的转述：PSPP purchases lead to higher bid-ask spreads (4-8 basis points per EUR100 million) and lower order book depth (1.3-1.6 million EUR per EUR100 million), indicating adverse liquidity effects.
- 证据等级：A

### E4
- 证据类型：Result
- 定位信息：Section VI.A, Figure6a, Table11
- 原文关键句："The immediate price impact in an illiquid market is about4 times larger than in liquid periods."
- 我的转述：The price impact of PSPP purchases is approximately four times larger in illiquid markets (measured by above-average bid-ask spreads) than in liquid markets.
- 证据等级：A

### E5
- 证据类型：Result
- 定位信息：Section VI.B, Table13
- 原文关键句："Closest substitute bonds respond positively but to a lesser extent than the group of all bonds at the daily frequency."

### E6
- 证据类型：Definition

### E8
- 证据类型：Limitation

- 原文关键句："the scarcity effects of asset purchases can have adverse side effects on market functioning, too. For instance, the presence of a large unidirectional buyer can impact liquidity by exhausting dealers’ capacity to bear risk."

- 证据等级：A

## 3）主题笔记（Topic Notes）
### PSPP Program Design and Data Sources
依据E6, E7：The PSPP program targets Bunds with 2-30Y maturity and yields above the ECB deposit facility rate. Data includes intra-day PSPP purchase data from Bundesbank and MTS inter-dealer platform data for high-frequency and daily impact analysis.

### Price Impact of PSPP Purchases
依据E1, E2：High-frequency analysis shows an average1.6 bps price impact within5 minutes (persistent, no reversal). Daily analysis finds2.2-6.1 bps per EUR100M purchased, with stronger effects for bonds purchased multiple times or on consecutive days.

### Liquidity Effects of PSPP Purchases
依据E3：PSPP purchases lead to higher bid-ask spreads (4-8 bps per EUR100M) and lower order book depth (1.3-1.6M EUR per EUR100M), indicating adverse liquidity effects for purchased bonds.

### Conditional Impact of Purchases
依据E4：Price impact of PSPP purchases is four times larger in illiquid markets (above-average spreads) than in liquid markets, highlighting state-dependent policy effectiveness.

### Spillover to Substitute Bonds
依据E5：Closest substitute bonds (similar maturity) show smaller positive price impacts (2.2 bps per EUR100M) compared to purchased bonds, suggesting partial spillover via the portfolio balance channel.
