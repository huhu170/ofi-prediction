## 3）主题笔记（Topic Notes）
### Order Imbalance Definition and Measurement
依据E1、E2：Order imbalance is measured via shares or dollar volume differences between buyer and seller-initiated trades. Trade direction is identified using the Lee and Ready (1991) algorithm without the five-second delay.

### Market Makers' Liquidity Supply Response
依据E3、E5、E7：Order imbalance does not affect spreads but influences quoted depths and competition. Market makers adjust depths to handle imbalance and are more competitive on bid/ask sides during down/up days.

### Investor Behavior Dynamics
依据E9、E10：Investors underreact to good news in bear markets. Buy/sell size differences vary with market conditions—buy size dominates up-days, sell size dominates down-days.

### Study Limitations
依据E8、E11：The sample is limited to Internet-related Nasdaq stocks during the bubble burst. Lack of individual inventory data restricts direct inventory analysis.

## 4）可直接写进论文的句子草稿（可选）
1. Order imbalance, defined as the difference between buyer and seller-initiated trades (in shares or dollars), is a core variable for analyzing market makers' liquidity supply (依据E1).
2. For Nasdaq market makers, order imbalance affects quoted prices but not spreads, aligning with inventory models that assume spreads are independent of inventory levels (依据E3).  
3. Market makers adjust quoted depths strategically—they increase ask-side depths during up-days (excess buying) and bid-side depths during down-days (excess selling) (依据E5).  
4. Nasdaq market makers are more competitive on the bid side during down-days and ask side during up-days, as reflected in quote frequency differences (依据E7).  
5. Investors underreact to good news in bear markets, with smaller order imbalances on up-days compared to bull markets (依据E9).
