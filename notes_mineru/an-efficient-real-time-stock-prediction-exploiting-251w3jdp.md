## 3）主题笔记（Topic Notes）
### Effectiveness of B-LSTM Model
依据证据E1、E4、E6：Bidirectional LSTM (B-LSTM) is the top-performing model for 15-minute stock price prediction across NSE and NASDAQ, with MAPE close to zero and lowest RMSE/MAE.

### Multivariate vs Univariate Models
依据证据E2、E5：Multivariate models incorporating EMA(10) and VWAP outperform univariate models, as they consider more independent variables for accurate forecasting.

### Latency Comparison Between Learning Approaches
依据证据E3：Offline-Online models have lower forecasting latency (617ms) than incremental models (940ms), making them more suitable for real-time applications.

### Limitations of Offline-Online Models
依据证据E7：Offline-Online models require post-trading session retraining and large historical data, which may limit their use for stocks with insufficient data.
