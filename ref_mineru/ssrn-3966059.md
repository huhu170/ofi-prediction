# Abstract

Using their exclusive access to retail order flow, wholesalers internalize unequal amounts of retail buy and sell orders to provide liquidity to institutional investors. Shocks to revenues/costs of internalization reveal that wholesaler choices determine observable internalized retail-trade imbalances. Large imbalances signify scarce institutional liquidity, manifested in high institutional trading costs. Consistent with internalized orders providing liquidity rather than being informed, intraday returns move in the same direction as institutional trading but the opposite direction of retail trade imbalances reflecting wholesalers intermediating between retail and institutional investors. The subsequent unwinding of institutional price pressure underlies the positive return predictability of imbalances.

# 1 Introduction

Wholesalers are high-frequency market makers (HFMMs) who provide trade execution services to retail brokers1 and liquidity to institutional investors.2 Wholesalers handle the vast majority of retail orders, and they choose between filling retail orders against their own capital by internalizing orders and rerouting them to other trading venues. Only in this latter case can other market participants directly interact with retail orders,3 reflecting how order flow segmentation precludes direct interaction between retail and institutional orders. Our paper shows how internalizing retail orders allows wholesalers to source liquidity that they then provide to institutional investors, especially when liquidity is scarce.

We provide the first evidence of this intermediation and its implications for liquiditydriven return predictability in modern U.S. equity markets. The challenge with characterizing this intermediation is the unavailability of wholesaler inventory data. We address this challenge by exploiting publicly-available data on trades that largely reflect wholesaler-retail transactions. Retail brokers allow wholesalers to handle their customer orders, in part, to obtain sub-penny price improvements (PI) for their retail customers. Using observable subpenny PI in market data, Boehmer, Jones, Zhang, and Zhang (2021, BJZZ) propose an algorithm that estimates imbalances in internalized marketable retail order flow. Importantly, SEC (2022) implies that this algorithm identifies less than 40% of all marketable retail orders.4 Our analysis demonstrates that, in fact, this selection helps identify a subset of retail orders that wholesalers internalize to provide liquidity to institutions.5

Like BJZZ, we find imbalances in internalized marketable retail flow, denoted Mroib, vary across stocks and robustly predict future stock returns for many weeks. However, rather than reflecting informed retail trading, as suggested by BJZZ, we show this return predictability is attributable to the subsequent unwinding of institutional price pressure, consistent with the algorithm’s identification of retail liquidity provision to institutions when liquidity is scarce.6 We provide evidence that large imbalances in observable internalized retail trades— large $| M r o i b |$ —reflect the internalized retail orders used by wholesalers to balance their inventories when providing liquidity to institutional investors. Barardehi et al. (2022) provide additional asset pricing evidence of this intermediation, showing that stock-level average $| M r o i b |$ proxies for institutional trading costs: (i) $| M r o i b |$ strongly outperforms all existing liquidity measures at capturing institutional trading costs at both the individual stock and investor levels; and (ii) conditioning on $| M r o i b |$ reveals annualized liquidity premia of 3% in the cross-section of expected returns post-2010.

Figure 1: Retail Imbalances versus Institutional Imbalances and Price Impacts. This figure plots institutional trade imbalances constructed from ANcerno data and institutional-trade price impacts against imbalances in internalized retail order flow (Mroibvol). Each week, stocks are sorted into deciles according to their respective internalized retail order flow imbalance. The averages of institutional trade imbalance and institutional price impact are then calculated within each decile each week using ANcerno data. Time-series means of these averages for each decile are plotted from 2010–2014.

Panel A: Institutional trade imbalance   
Panel B : Institutional price impact   
Figure 1 illustrates two properties of M roib that highlight the liquidity provision facili-

tated by retail order flow internalization. Panel A shows that institutional trade imbalances are inversely related to retail imbalances, while Panel B shows that institutional price impacts are highest when absolute retail imbalances are largest. These patterns suggest that large imbalances in internalized retail order flow reflect the internalization choices of wholesalers in response to the liquidity demands of institutions facing high trading costs. In addition to the visual evidence in Figure 1, extreme Mroib is associated with (i) abnormally low trading volumes indicative of illiquidity; (ii) larger opposing changes in short interest, signifying higher imbalances in institutional liquidity demand; and (iii) abnormally low Alternative Trading System (ATS) volume, indicating limited trading interest from institutional counter-parties.

Wholesalers internalize about 80% of the marketable retail orders received (SEC 2022),7 and BJZZ’s algorithm identifies only a select subset of these trades. The algorithm’s systematic selection of a subset of retail trades is key to our analysis for at least three reasons.

First, the BJZZ algorithm excludes retail trades filled at the NBBO. Retail brokers, typically in return for payment for order flow (PFOF), outsource handling of customer orders to wholesalers who provide trade execution services in return for the option to fill retail orders before other market participants. Wholesalers have three main options: (1) internalize orders; (2) execute them on a riskless principal basis by rerouting orders to a market center, where non-midpoint sub-penny execution prices are prohibited; and (3) reroute them to another wholesaler. Over 42% (8 $\%$ ) of rerouted (all) retail orders fill at the NBBO (SEC 2022), implying that the algorithm excludes retail trades that wholesalers choose to not internalize.

Second, the algorithm excludes midpoint-filled retail trades that account for a large share of omitted trades and reflect the “best execution” requirements of brokers.8 These requirements force wholesalers to internalize orders at the midpoint when they detect undisplayed midpoint liquidity, e.g., as a result of pinging some exchange/ATS for midpoint liquidity. SEC (2022) reports that over $3 1 \%$ of all retail orders are filled at the quote midpoint (also see Battalio et al. 2022b). Importantly, such trades reflect regulatory requirements and not the endogenous internalization choices of wholesalers to source liquidity for their institutional clients. Hence, excluding these trades, which tend to occur when institutional midpoint liquidity is abundant, improves our identification of retail trades internalized by wholesalers to provide liquidity to institutional investors when liquidity is scarce.9

Finally, reflecting wholesaler internalization choices, 55% of retail trades reflect nonmidpoint internalized orders that receive PI (SEC 2022), and BJZZ’s algorithm picks up such trades with sub-penny PI.10 Collectively, the algorithm, by focusing on a selected subset of retail trades, makes observable those retail trades that wholesalers choose to internalize.

The U.S. equity market structure gives wholesalers a competitive advantage in providing liquidity to institutions in less liquid markets, leading to observable wholesaler choices. In addition to intermediating between retail buyers and sellers, a wholesaler interacts as a HFMM with institutional investors on registered exchanges, ATSs, and its own SDP. However, reflecting order flow segmentation, U.S. wholesalers do not compete with retail investors when providing liquidity to institutions.11 Instead, they may use internalized retail flow as an exclusive inventory management mechanism (Baldauf et al. 2022). This allows wholesalers to offset inventory accumulated from filling unbalanced institutional order flow by choosing to internalize disproportionately more retail order flow from the opposing side of the market, especially when liquidity is scarce. Simultaneous offsetting of institutional inventory using internalized retail orders also mitigates wholesalers’ exposure to toxic (informed) institutional orders. Crucially, the internalized retail orders that facilitate this intermediation often involve sub-penny retail execution prices due to PI and are observable by BJZZ’s algorithm.

We document that when unbalanced institutional liquidity demand and trading costs spike, so does the marginal cost of internalization to wholesalers in the form of increased PI or PFOF. This evidence indicates that wholesalers respond to the increased demand for liquidity from liquidity-constrained institutional investors by internalizing costlier retail order flow. Indeed, contrary to wholesalers always offering minimal PI, we find that about $3 5 \%$ of off-exchange transactions featuring sub-penny prices are executed at prices more than $1 \Phi$ inside the NBBO. This observation is consistent with wholesalers (i) offering greater-than- $1 \Phi$ PI to marketable orders due to best execution requirements when inside-quote odd-lot/hidden liquidity exists, or (ii) profitably internalizing non-marketable limit orders quoted inside the NBBO with PI plus PFOF that is often double that for marketable orders.12 In both scenarios, such costly internalization remains profitable for wholesalers because institutions with a high demand for liquidity tend to trade near the NBBO. Intuitively, wholesalers are willing to exercise their option to internalize costlier retail order flow in order to facilitate inventory management while filling unusually profitable institutional orders in less liquid markets.

To provide a foundation for our empirical analysis, we analyze a simple theoretical framework that features an optimizing wholesaler who trades with retail investors via internalization and with institutional investors on other trading venues. The wholesaler incurs inventory costs from holding positions that deviate from its preferred holdings. We show that in the absence of institutional liquidity demand, a wholesaler internalizes roughly equal amounts of retail buy and sell orders, rerouting the remaining retail orders, resulting in a near-zero M roib. In contrast, with high institutional demand, a wholesaler internalizes retail order flow to offset institutional liquidity demand, resulting in large positive or negative M roib. Thus, in circumstances where internalized retail order flow would otherwise be balanced, unbalanced institutional demand for liquidity creates a large (absolute) Mroib.

We exploit the Tick Size Pilot to identify the effects of the cost-benefit internalization tradeoffs for wholesalers on M roib. An increase in the tick size (from $1 \Phi$ to $5 \Phi$ ) increases the potential liquidity-provision profit of wholesalers. We show this leads to increased internalization. In contrast, a joint increase in both the tick size and the minimum PI requirement (from 0.01¢ to 0.5¢) reduces internalization but raises $| M r o i b |$ . The 50-fold increase in minimum PI raises the minimum cost of internalization when matching marketable retail buy and retail sell orders from $0 . 0 2 \mathrm { { c } }$ to $1 \Phi$ (absent inside quote hidden liquidity), which reduces internalization. This decline in round-trip retail order internalization is greater than that for retail orders matched against the more profitable institutional orders, as institutional orders are executed at NBBO and do not require a minimum PI—causing $| M r o i b |$ to increase.13 Thus, we link imbalances in M roib to wholesaler choices to internalize marginal retail orders that are significantly more costly to internalize. This link allows us to conclude that wholesaler choices determine Mroib in response to the higher marginal profits obtained from internalizing retail order flow when institutions’ willingness to pay for liquidity on the opposite side is high.

Cross-sectional tests highlight the impact of institutional liquidity demand on M roib. ANcerno and FINRA data indicate that internalization of more retail sell orders than buy orders is associated with more institutional buy volume than sell volume, and more covering of short positions by short sellers. Similarly, the internalization of more retail buy orders than sell orders is associated with more institutional selling and increased short interest. Consistent with a lack of institutional counter-parties to offset institutional imbalances on ATSs, a larger $| M r o i b |$ is associated with abnormally low quote-midpoint liquidity. In addition, larger $| M r o i b |$ is associated with wider quoted spreads and lower quoted depth. Mirroring these effects, both institutional trading costs and internalization costs are ∪-shaped in M roib. These revealed low levels of liquidity present wholesalers with opportunities to fill institutional orders at wide spreads while maintaining a balanced inventory by internalizing costlier retail order flow. Finally, we show that consistent with retail liquidity provision to institutions, but not informed retail trading, contemporaneous intraday prices move in the same direction as institutional trade imbalances and thus in the opposite direction of Mroib. $^ { 1 4 }$

Cross-sectional regressions of stock returns on M roib reveal that higher M roib is associated with higher near-term future weekly returns (through 12 weeks). However, the relation between Mroib and future returns quickly becomes ∪-shaped by week 3. This ∪- shape persists for well beyond a year, and is consistent with a liquidity premia demanded by institutional investors for holding less liquid stocks (Barardehi et al. 2022). The nearterm return predictability of M roib is reconciled by price reversals following price pressure induced by persistent institutional trading, especially institutional buying (Hendershott and Seasholes 2007, Akepanidtaworn et al. 2021). Specifically, negative current Mroib (retail selling, institutional buying) is associated with lower future returns for several weeks due to the unwinding of institutional price pressure. Further decomposing daily returns into intraday and overnight returns sheds further light on the liquidity-driven price dynamics, with intraday institutional price pressure followed by overnight reversals.

# 2 Related Literature and Contributions

Our study provides the first evidence that wholesaler internalization of retail order flow is a mechanism for providing liquidity to institutional investors. Thus, we extend the literature on liquidity provision by retail investors (Kaniel et al. 2008; Kaniel et al. 2012). Consistent with our evidence on retail-sourced liquidity, Easley et al. (1996) and Bessembinder and Kaufman (1997) report that internalized orders are less informed. Our finding that return predictability can, in part, be attributed to internalization of non-marketable retail orders is consistent with Kelley and Tetlock (2013). Barrot et al. (2016) provide evidence that liquidity provision by retail investors is unintentional; they use proprietary data to identify retail liquidity provision that goes uncompensated because they trade before the price pressure from institutional trading is fully realized and fail to unwind positions before price pressure reverts. Using more comprehensive data, we extend these insights and highlight the incentives of wholesalers to facilitate liquidity provision by retail investors to institutional investors.

Theoretical models have identified when order flow internalization harms market quality, liquidity, or welfare on exchanges (Battalio and Holden 1995; Bernhardt et al. 2001; Parlour and Rajan 2003; Parlour and Seppi 2003). However, empirical studies motivated by these predictions are inconclusive (Battalio et al. 1997; Battalio et al. 2003; Peterson and Sirri 2003; Battalio 2012). Recently, Amirian and Norden (2021) document the adverse effects of SDPs on liquidity in Europe. Consistent with these conclusions, we find that order flow segmentation allows wholesalers to profitably intermediate between retail and institutional investors, especially when liquidity is scarce. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding the welfare effects of order flow segmentation, a topic of recent policy debate.15

Our paper also contributes to a literature on the return predictability of retail order flow. This predictability is often attributed to informed trading by retail investors using aggressive market orders (Kelley and Tetlock 2013) or to liquidity provision by retail investors to market participants whose trades induce price pressure that is later reversed (Kaniel, Saar, and Titman 2008).16 Determining which channel best explains retail order flow’s return predictability is challenging due to the difficulty in observing retail trading activity.17 BJZZ address this challenge by constructing Mroib, which uses TAQ data and predicts future returns.

Our findings are robust to the BJZZ algorithm’s potential to flag institutional trades as retail. Battalio et al. (2022b) show these institutional trades largely reflect trades associated with VWAP executions or trades filled at sub-penny prices on SDPs. VWAP trades tend to reflect low demand for immediacy, so this error is more likely when Mroib is balanced, and hence cannot impact our qualitative findings. Battalio et al. find that BJZZ’s algorithm correctly signs 94% of the retail trades identified. In contrast, the algorithm mis-signs 80% of institutional trades that the algorithm flags in error as retail.18 We investigate this combination of incorrectly selected and signed institutional orders in two ways. Section 6.2 applies the algorithm to ANcerno sub-penny execution prices to construct a BJZZ-implied institutional trade imbalance. These imbalances are flat in Mroib, indicating that the negative association between M roib and actual institutional flow is not an artifact of mis-classified institutional trades that enter M roib. Section 7.4 further shows that reconstructing M roib to correct misclassification by signing trades relative to the quote midpoints minimally alters our results.

Our findings also relate to the literature on liquidity timing.19 Investors with pressing needs to quickly establish or unwind a position may have limited ability to time their trades. This leads Anand et al. (2013) to classify institutional investors as “liquidity demanding” and “liquidity supplying” with the former incurring higher trading costs. Institutional investors accessing liquidity via the internalization of retail order flow in our study are likely “liquidity demanding” institutions. Battalio et al. (2022) document higher execution shortfalls for institutional “parent” orders that seek liquidity on SDPs that are typically operated by wholesalers who obtain liquidity by internalizing retail order flow.20 Our analysis extends these insights by showing that institutions differentially access the liquidity provided by internalized retail order flow when mid-point off-exchange liquidity is scarce. This indicates how wholesalers gain from their access to segmented retail order flow, which they can use for inventory management purposes to offset high institutional demand in less liquid markets.

Finally, we contribute to research that seeks to understand intraday versus overnight return differences. Cliff et al. (2008) and Berkman et al. (2012) document that overnight returns are positive and intraday returns are negative, on average. Hendershott et al. (2020) show that CAPM holds overnight but not intraday, and attribute intraday deviations from CAPM to noise trading. Bogousslavsky (2021) finds that arbitrageurs tend to close positions near the end of a trading day. Intraday return variation induced by closing arbitrage positions allows a mispricing factor to explain intraday returns but not overnight returns. Lou et al. (2019) find that intraday and overnight returns exhibit strong persistence vis \`a vis past intraday and overnight returns, respectively, but strong reversals relative to overnight and intraday returns. They posit that clientele effects underlie these patterns. However, we find that persistence in institutional liquidity demand leads to the accumulation of price pressure during consecutive trading days that is partially reversed each night. This partial overnight reversal in conjunction with daytime persistence explains the distinct auto-correlations of daytime versus overnight returns. This suggests that deviations of intraday returns from CAPM can be attributed to liquidity premia being primarily embedded into intraday returns.

# 3 Institutional Details and Hypothesis Development

Execution of a retail order in U.S. equity markets follows one of several paths depending on the decisions of three entities: a retail investor, a retail broker (broker-dealer), and an off-exchange market maker (wholesaler). The retail investor chooses an order type, occasionally using a “directed order” to specifying a particular trading venue.21 By default, retail brokers determine where to route all “non-directed” orders. Most retail brokers outsource the handling of almost all non-directed retail orders to wholesalers. This makes wholesaler decisions about which retail orders to internalize crucial.

Order choice: Retail investors choose an order type from alternatives that include market, marketable limit, and non-marketable limit orders.22 Ignoring price improvement, a market buy order is executed at the best ask price at the time of execution. A marketable limit order also seeks immediate execution at the best price, but it specifies a limit price no better than the current NBBO. Order types reflect their status when received by a wholesaler, and rapid updates in the order book can cause non-marketable orders to become marketable or vice versa. Thus, a marketable buy limit order is either executed at that price or it enters the limit order book at that price if the best ask price rose in the interim leaving the order unfilled.

Order routing: In practice, retail brokers commonly route all of their order flow to wholesalers according to pre-negotiated terms. A wholesaler makes payment for order flow and provides execution services to brokers in exchange for access to retail order flow before other market participants. In addition to PFOF, the wholesaler offers sub-penny price improvement (PI) that is passed on by the broker to the retail investor. This satisfies their “Best Execution” duties $^ { 2 3 }$ by ensuring the execution price is never worse than the best quoted price displayed on exchanges at the time of the transaction.

These details highlight the need to distinguish quoted prices from execution prices. For limit orders, a retail investor quotes a price for an order, while market orders seek execution at best available prices. Rule 612 of RegNMS generally requires all orders to be quoted at penny increments. However, retail trade execution is governed by the “Best Execution” duties of retail brokers. As a result, the execution of any retail market order or retail limit order may involve sub-penny price improvements, and hence sub-penny execution prices. $^ { 2 4 }$ Figure 6 in Section 7.4 shows that the most common sub-penny price improvement is $0 . 0 1 \mathrm { { c } }$ and that over $9 5 \%$ of orders receiving this tiny amount are priced at the NBBO when executed, indicating that they are marketable orders. However, larger price improvements of $0 . 1 \Phi$ , 0.2¢, 0.25¢, 0.3¢, and 0.4¢ also occur and are several times more likely for executions inside the NBBO. In other words, a non-trivial fraction of internalized orders are filled at prices more than ${ \mathrm { 1 \Phi } } _ { \mathrm { 4 } }$ inside the NBBO. This finding may reflect either the effect of “Manning” rule where a wholesaler must beat the pricing of inside quote hidden liquidity to satisfy best execution, or a wholesaler choosing to internalize non-marketable order quoted between the midpoint and NBBO.25

Internalization by a wholesaler: The process by which wholesalers execute retail order flow against their own inventory is referred to as internalization. In May 2012, internalized retail order flow comprised roughly 8% of consolidated trading volume on NMS stocks (Tuttle 2014). Reflecting the increased participation of retail investors, this fraction was 20% in September 2021 (Rosenblatt 2021). Wholesalers are usually registered brokers, but are not subject to the rules of registered exchanges or ATSs. Most notably, wholesalers can execute trades at sub-penny prices despite the $1 \Phi$ minimum tick size. This flexibility allows wholesalers to coordinate with retail brokers and execute retail orders at sub-penny prices after offering price improvements that fulfill their “Best Execution” duties.

Panel A in Table 1 reports the distribution of order types across all non-directed orders and all retail volume executed by wholesalers, along with the average PFOF for each order type. Market orders and marketable limit orders account for a disproportionately large share of executed volume receiving PFOF, indicating that wholesalers prefer internalizing marketable orders to internalizing non-marketable orders. Simple calculations suggest that the share of executed volume of non-marketable limit orders receiving PFOF is only one fourth that of marketable orders. Of note, non-marketable limit orders executed by wholesalers receive over twice as much PFOF per share as marketable orders.

PFOF and PI combine to determine the direct internalization costs to a wholesaler. PFOF and average PI generally reflect pre-negotiated terms between brokers and wholesalers, with brokers often trying to obtain the most favorable average PI for their retail customers. However, there is significant variation in PI at the individual transaction level. Calculations in Section 7.4 that compare each execution price with the corresponding NBBO suggest that over 50% of observable internalized marketable orders receive sub-penny PI of no more than 0.1¢. In contrast, underscoring the significant variation in wholesaler internalization costs, over 35% of internalized orders are executed at prices that are inside the NBBO by over $1 \Phi$ .

Institutional details suggest two channels underlie these large PIs. Most importantly, the Manning rule requires wholesalers with access to proprietary data feeds on hidden liquidity to use any inside-quote liquidity to determine best execution terms. Due to the $1 \Phi$ tick size, inside-quote hidden liquidity is quoted at $1 \Phi$ price increments. Thus, when such liquidity exists, to price improve over the “best available price” some internalized marketable retail orders must receive greater-than- $1 \Phi$ PI. Second, internalized orders executed at prices over $1 \Phi$ inside the NBBO may be inside-NBBO non-marketable limit orders, originally placed as marketable orders.26 Internalizing such non-marketable limit orders is highly costly even when executed at minimal PI because non-marketable orders receive much higher PFOF.

Wholesaler interactions with institutions take more direct forms as well. Most major wholesalers, including Citadel Securities and Virtu Americas LLC, own Single Dealer Platforms (SDPs). On SDPs, which are also known as ping pools, a select set of institutions and institutional brokers trade against the wholesaler.27 SDPs date back to 2005, and were originally referred to as Electronic Liquidity Providers (ELPs).28 By 2017, over 2.5% of all trading in NMS stocks occurred on SDPs, comprising roughly 30% of all internalized retail order flow.29 An institution may “ping” a wholesaler on its affiliated SDP, often using Indication of Interest (IOI) or Immediate or Cancel (IOC) orders, thereby signaling an unusually high demand for liquidity. This signal encourages the wholesaler to intermediate between retail and institutional investors by providing liquidity to the institution with liquidity sourced from retail order flow.30 In 2021, Citadel and Virtu combined to execute nearly 17% of consolidated volume in the U.S. by internalizing retail order flow, and their affiliated SDPs accounted for over 4% of consolidated trading volume (Rosenblatt 2021). Put differently, they internalized about 425 shares of retail orders per 100 shares executed on their SDPs.

When a wholesaler matches internalized retail buy (sell) order flow with unbalanced institutional sell (buy) liquidity demand, the internalized retail orders often receive sub-penny price improvements. Consequently, the corresponding Mroib will be unbalanced and inversely related to institutional liquidity demand. As institutions with high liquidity demand are prepared to pay more to wholesalers, wholesalers can pay higher internalization costs in the form of high PI or high PFOF, internalizing orders that are executed by more that ${ \mathrm { 1 \Phi } } _ { \mathrm { 4 } }$ inside the NBBO. This leads to a positive relation between $| M r o i b |$ and the intensity with which these high cost orders are internalized. Internet Appendix A provides a stylized setting to show formally how a wholesaler’s internalization choices, rather than the underlying retail order flow received, determine most of the variation in M roib. Institutional details and this analysis of wholesaler incentives suggest two hypotheses:

Hypothesis 1: Wholesalers choices to internalize highly unequal amounts of retail buy and sell orders reflect their optimal responses to high institutional liquidity demand.

Hypothesis 2: Price reversals following institutional price pressure underlie the near-term return predictability of imbalances in internalized retail trade.

# 4 Data

We follow BJZZ to construct our main sample. Our sample spans January, 2010 to December, 2014, covering common shares listed on the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ.31 We use daily open and close price information from CRSP’s Daily Stock File to calculate three measures of daily returns: the standard close-to-close (CC) return, the open-to-close intraday (ID) return, and the close-to-open overnight (ON) return. Our construction accounts for overnight adjustments and, to minimize the impact of bid-ask bounce, is based on quote midpoints at close. We then aggregate daily log-return observations into overlapping 5-day rolling windows to construct daily cross-sections of 5-day (weekly) returns, as in BJZZ. We include a stock-day observation in our sample if it had a closing price of at least $\$ 1$ at the end of the previous calendar month.

We use BJZZ’s algorithm to construct measures of internalized retail order flow. Using

TAQ data, we focus on round-lot orders executed off-exchange (transactions with exchange flag “D”) that feature sub-penny execution prices. $^ { 3 2 }$ A transaction is classified as a retail buy order if the sub-penny (sub-tick) increment exceeds 0.6¢ and is classified as a retail sell order if the sub-penny increment is less than $0 . 4 \Phi$ .33 We construct daily, normalized measures of imbalance in internalized retail order flow trade frequency and trade volume. $M r o i b t r d =$ $( M r b t r d - M r s t r d ) / ( M r b t r d + M r s t r d )$ divides the difference between the number of internalized retail buy and internalized retail sell orders by their sum, while $M r o i b v o l =$ $( M r b v o l - M r s v o l ) / ( M r b v o l + M r s v o l )$ is the normalized difference in internalized trade volume. Panel B in Table 1 reports the summary statistics for these measures, which closely match the BJZZ summary statistics. We then aggregate these daily observations of normalized internalized retail order flow imbalances into overlapping 5-day rolling windows to construct daily cross-sections of 5-day (weekly) internalized retail order flow imbalances.

Using Quote and NBBO files in Daily TAQ database, we match each identified internalized retail transaction with the National Best Bid and Offer prices at the same millisecond. We calculate the daily fractions of internalized retail volume executed at prices that are at least $1 \Phi$ better than the NBBO at the time of transaction. We then match 5-day rolling average of these fractions with the 5-day (weekly) internalized retail order flow imbalances.

ANcerno data from 2010-2014 provide institutional trade sizes, buy versus sell indicators, execution prices, and stock identifiers. We aggregate institutional buy and sell trade separately at the stock-day level to construct institutional buy and sell volumes. Using these volumes, we construct the institutional analogue of Mroibvol denoted Inroibvol. We also construct institutional price impact measures. For each stock-day, we calculate volume-weighted average buy and sell execution prices across institutional investors. The price impact of a typical institutional buy trade equals the average execution price minus the open price divided by the open price and scaled by the trade’s dollar value in millions. Similarly, the price impact of a typical institutional sell trade equals open price minus the average execution price divided by the open price and scaled by the trade’s dollar value in millions. To maintain consistency with our other analysis, we aggregate institutional trading outcomes over 5-day rolling windows to construct daily cross-sections of 5-day (weekly) institutional trading outcomes.

We construct stock characteristics using information from CRSP’s Daily and Monthly Stock Files and Compustat. Using CRSP data, we construct each stock’s return volatility using daily observations from the preceding month (VOLAT). A stock’s book-to-market (BM) ratio equals its most recent book value of equity divided by its market capitalization from the previous month.34 Past return measures include the previous month’s return $R E T _ { - 1 }$ ) and the compound return over the preceding 5 months $\left( R E T _ { ( - 6 , - 2 ) } \right)$ . The previous month’s turnover (TO) equals the ratio of the previous month’s share volume to shares outstanding, and Size equals the firm’s market capitalization at the end of the previous month.

We obtain the identifying information for control and treatment stocks in the U.S. Tick Size Pilot program (TSP) from FINRA’s website, focusing on Test Groups 1 and 2. For each stock, we construct daily observations over the 10 trading days prior to implementation of TSP on 10/03/2016 as well as the 10 trading days after full implementation on 10/17/2016.35 From Daily TAQ’s Trades, Quotes, and NBBO files, we obtain trade and quote information to match off-exchange transactions executed at sub-penny prices with the national best bid and ask prices at the time of transaction based on millisecond timestamps. Then, for each stock-day, we construct the following outcome variables: (1) the absolute value of Mroibtrd; (2) the absolute value of Mroibvol; (3) size-weighted average relative percentage price improvement, which divides the relative price improvement for a sub-penny-executed transaction (i.e., the difference between the best quoted price and the transaction price) by the mid-point of best bid and ask; (4) total dollar-denominated price improvement, which is the sum of dollar relative price improvements across all sub-penny-executed transactions; (5) the total share volume of trades receiving price improvement; and (6) the size-weighted average sub-tick (sub-penny) fraction of trades receiving price improvement.

# 5 Minimum Tick Sizes and Internalization

In this section, we exploit the design of the Tick Size Pilot to establish that variation in Mroibtrd and Mroibvol reflects the internalization decisions of wholesalers. We first examine the response in a wholesaler’s appetite to internalize, proxied by the extent of off-exchange sub-penny BJZZ-identified trading volume, to a shock in the profitability of wholesaler liquidity provision. More importantly, we also analyze the effect of a shock to the cost of internalization on imbalances in Mroibtrd and M roibvol. This analysis allows us to link wholesaler cost-benefit considerations to their choices of which retail orders to internalize.

The SEC implemented the Tick Size Pilot program (TSP) on October 3, 2016. This program offered an experimental design for studying the causal impact of the minimum tick size on trading outcomes. The program included 2,400 securities. To ensure that stocks were randomly assigned to control and treatment groups, stocks were sorted into 27 categories based on share price, market-capitalization, and trading volume terciles. Across these categories, stocks were randomly assigned to three treatment groups of 400 stocks each. Treated stocks in Test Group 1 were subject to a minimum quoting requirement of 5¢ but could trade at price increments of $1 \Phi$ —the quote rule (Rindi and Werner 2018). Treated stocks in Test Groups 2 and 3 were subject to a minimum quoting requirement of $5 \Phi$ and had to trade at price increments of 5¢—the trade rule (Rindi and Werner 2018). Test Group 3 stocks were also subject to a Trade-At Prohibition provision that effectively prevented sub-penny off-exchange execution prices, rendering test Group 3 irrelevant for our study (see Hu and Murphy 2022).36

A key exception to the minimum tick size applied to retail trades. Although retail trades are quoted using the minimum tick size, they could be executed at sub-penny prices offexchange. While TSP did not restrict the magnitudes of PI for test Group 1, the program imposed a minimum PI of $0 . 5 \Phi$ for off-exchange retail order executions of Test Group 2 stocks, raising the cost of internalizing orders in test Group 2 stocks above that for control and test Group 1 stocks. $^ { 3 7 }$ This key difference provides an opportunity to examine the causal impacts of internalization costs on M roib imbalances.

BJZZ’s algorithm is designed to detect sub-penny execution prices in a $1 \Phi$ tick size regime, but it can be scaled to detect sub-tick execution prices in any tick size regime. To do this for Test Group 2, after activation of the Trade Rule, we re-scale the algorithm’s command that classifies trades according to small vs. large sub-penny increments by a factor of 5: in BJZZ’s notation, we replace $' Z _ { j t } = 1 0 0 * \mathrm { m o d } ( P _ { j t } , 0 . 0 1 ) "$ by $^ { \cdot } Z _ { j t } ^ { 5 } = 2 0 * \mathrm { m o d } ( P _ { j t } , 0 . 0 5 ) ^ { \cdot \rangle }$ , where $Z _ { j t } ^ { 5 }$ is the sub-tick execution price $( P _ { j t } )$ increment for a $5 \Phi$ tick size. With this scaling, $Z _ { i t } ^ { 5 } \in [ 0 , 1 ]$ and transactions can be classified into retail buy and retail sell trades as in Section 4.

The TPS provides an ideal setting to study the economics of retail flow internalization by wholesalers since the experiment raises (i) the profitability of off-exchange liquidity provision in all test groups (Rindi and Werner 2018); and (ii) the costs of internalization in test Group 2. These impacts let us conclude that variation in Mroibtrd and Mroibvol is determined by wholesaler decisions to internalize specific retail orders. We use the following Difference-in-Difference (DiD) methodology to examine the causal impact of a tick size change:

$$
X _ { j , d } = b _ { 0 } ^ { g } + b _ { 1 } ^ { g } ( \mathrm { P o s t } _ { d } ) + b _ { 2 } ^ { g } ( \mathrm { T r e a t } _ { j } ^ { g } ) + b _ { 3 } ^ { g } ( \mathrm { P o s t } _ { j } ) \times ( \mathrm { T r e a t } _ { d } ^ { g } ) + u _ { j , d } .
$$

Here $d \in [ - 1 1 , - 1 ]$ indexes the 11 trading days ending on 10/02/2016, and $d \in \lfloor 0 , 1 0 \rfloor$ indexes the 11 trading days beginning on 10/17/2016. $^ { 3 8 }$ $X _ { j , d }$ is stock $j$ ’s outcome variable on trading day $d$ ; $\mathrm { P o s t } _ { d }$ is an indicator variable that equals 0 if $d < 0$ and 1 if $d \geq 0$ . Treatment $\mathbf { \Sigma } _ { j } ^ { g }$ is an indicator variable that equals 0 if stock $j$ is in the control group and 1 if stock $j$ is in the treatment group for Test Group $g \in \{ 1 , 2 \}$ . The coefficient $b _ { 3 } ^ { y }$ captures the treatment effects associated with Test Group $g$ . To ensure that estimated treatment effects are unaffected by outliers, we use both OLS and quantile (median) regressions to estimate equation (5). Following standard practice (see Rindi and Werner 2019, Griffith and Roseman 2019, Albuquerque et al. 2020), we condition estimates on quoted spread levels prior to the introduction of TSP.

Table 2 presents estimation results for Test Group 1. Panels A-C in Figure 4 provide complementary visual evidence. The quote rule raises the average and median volume of sub-penny-executed trades by 9% and 63% relative to the corresponding intercept, respectively.39 This indicates that the quote rule causes wholesalers to internalize retail orders more aggressively. The effects are stronger for stocks with tighter pre-TSP quoted spreads—stocks that are more likely to have binding quote test restrictions.

Consider a low spread stock for which the $5 \Phi$ minimum spread reflects an exogenouslywidened quoted spread. For example, suppose marketable limit buy and sell orders were quoted at best prices of $\$ 10.02$ and $\$ 909$ , respectively, before the spread was widened to $\$ 10.03$ and $\$ 9.98$ . This widening of the spread increases depth at the best price, facilitating larger transactions (Rindi and Werner 2019). However, the aggregate amount of order flow that a wholesaler would otherwise have internalized is unaffected, $^ { 4 0 }$ replacing the set of attractive non-marketable limit orders with marketable limit orders. $^ { 4 1 }$ More importantly, widening the quoted spread increased the profitability of off-exchange liquidity provision at the midpoint, increasing the willingness of wholesalers to internalize order flow.

Table 2 reports that the intensity of sub-penny-executed retail trades—as measured by the total volume of price-improved trades—rises due to the minimum $5 \Phi$ -spread. In contrast, the absolute values of Mroibvol and Mroibtrd fall, moving in the opposite direction of retail order flow internalization intensity. That is, Mroibvol and Mroibtrd respond to the economic incentives of wholesalers regarding retail order internalization rather than retail trading per se.

Table 3 presents estimation results for Test Group 2 that introduced a 0.5¢ minimum PI in addition to the 5¢ pricing increment. Panels D–F in Figure 4 provide complementary visual evidence. In contrast to the quote-rule treatment, the trade-rule treatment caused the absolute values of Mroibtrd and Mroibvol to increase dramatically, even though the treatment reduced the volume of internalized (sub-penny) trades. For stocks with tight spreads, median internalized trade volume fell by 47% relative to the corresponding intercept, while trade volume is unchanged for stocks with wide spreads.42

the orders that are more costly to internalize are the marginal retail orders used to provide liquidity to institutions through internalization. Section 7.4 provides further support for this prediction when M roib is constructed from retail orders with price improvement levels that are relatively more likely to be associated with internalized orders executed at prices falling over $1 \Phi$ inside the NBBO.

These findings based on the TSP reinforce conclusions that variations in Mroibtrd and Mroibvol are largely not due to imbalances in the underlying retail order flow. Instead, these measures reflect wholesaler decisions of whether to internalize retail order flow. Our findings also indicate that $M r o i b$ is unlikely to capture directional informed retail trading. Interpreting the higher $| M r o i b |$ associated with Test group 2 stocks as due to increased informed retail trading would imply that wholesalers pay more PFOF $^ +$ PI to internalize more toxic (informed) retail orders. This is hard to reconcile with any notion of profit-maximization by wholesalers. In contrast, the willingness to pay more for internalizing these marginal orders is consistent with wholesalers facilitating liquidity provision when institutional demand is high. Having established that wholesaler internalization choices are responsible for variation in Mroib, we now examine the cross-sectional variation in Mroib.

# 6 Internalized Retail Order Flow Imbalance (Mroib)

This section provides cross-sectional evidence of the impact of institutional liquidity demand on Mroib. We show that extremely positive or extremely negative Mroib both signify wholesalers intermediating between retail and institutional investors when the demand for liquidity by institutional investors is unbalanced and liquidity is scarce. We then analyze M roib’s return predictability, providing convincing evidence that Mroib’s return predictability is not due to informed retail trading but rather the unwinding on institutional price pressure.

# 6.1 Mroib and Trading Activity

We first examine how Mroib is related to overall trading volume and to the distribution of trading volume across four sources of trading activity: exchanges, ATSs, SDPs, and internalized retail order flow. This analysis provides insights into how each of these sources contributes to the overall trading activity as a function of the prevailing liquidity conditions. We obtain aggregate ATS and non-ATS off-exchange trading volumes at the stock-week level for 01/2019 through 06/2019 from FINRA. $^ { 4 4 }$ Aggregate non-ATS volume is primarily comprised of internalized retail order flow and SDP trading volume (see FINRA Regulatory Notice 18-28). We decompose non-ATS weekly volume into the trading volume identified as retail by BJZZ’s algorithm and a residual component. The residual volume is mostly a combination of internalized retail orders executed at (or near) the midpoint and SDP executed institutional volume. Since the midpoint internalized retail volume should be relatively higher when ATS liquidity is high, the opposite should hold for SDP volume.45 It follows that subtracting this “BJZZ volume” from non-ATS volume yields an over-estimate of SDP volume, especially when ATS midpoint liquidity is high. We construct overall trading volume at the stock-week level from daily observations provided by WRDS Intraday Indicators.

Panel A in Figure 2 reveals a striking ∩-shaped relationship between trading volume and Mroibvol, indicating that a large (absolute) M roib imbalance is associated with scarce liquidity. Total trading volume is over 80% lower in the extreme (unbalanced) Mroibvol deciles than in the middle deciles that feature near-zero (balanced) Mroibvol levels. These large declines in trading volume as Mroibvol becomes more unbalanced suggest a dry-up in overall liquidity. As a result, the probability an institution can find an institutional counterparty

Figure 2: Retail Imbalances versus Trading Volume and Volume Distribution Across Venues. This figure plots total trading volume during regular hours and the cross-venue distribution of trading volume against imbalances in internalized retail order flow (Mroibvol). Each calendar week, stocks are sorted into deciles according to their respective internalized retail order flow imbalance. Average trading volume as well as average shares of the volume executed on exchanges, on ATSs, on SDPs, and via internalization calculated within each decile each week. Time-series averages of these weekly averages for each decile are plotted from 01/2019 through 06/2019. Weekly ATS and non ATS volumes are obtained from FINRA. The non-ATS volume is decomposed into BJZZ volume, calculated using TAQ data, and SDP volume which is estimated as the difference between non-ATS and BJZZ (internalized retail) volume.

Panel B: Volume distribution by venue

with whom to trade falls, leaving HFMMs as the primary source for liquidity. Consistent with this, Panel B in Figure 2 presents a break-down of trading volume according to the source of trading activity. The shares of trading volume executed on exchanges and ATS both fall by over 2pps from the middle (balanced) deciles to the two extreme (unbalanced) deciles of Mroibvol. These declines for exchanges and ATSs are offset by increases of over 2pps in the shares of trading volume executed via SDPs and the internalization of retail order flow. We observe that because (1) BJZZ’s algorithm excludes all internalized retail trades executed at the midpoint and (2) midpoint ATS liquidity is significantly more abundant when Mroibvol closer to zero, our estimates of SDP volume are likely significantly biased upwards for intermediate levels of M roibvol. This suggests that the true ∪-shaped pattern of SDP volume share in Mroibvol is even stronger than that reported in Figure 2. Importantly, both sources of non-ATS trading activity almost exclusively reflect wholesaler trades.

These findings indicate that when liquidity is scarce, institutional investors access the liquidity provided by wholesalers, encouraging wholesalers to internalize more retail order flow. These interactions between institutional investors and wholesalers would lead to imbalances in wholesaler inventory absent their ability to internalize retail order flow. To avoid unbalancing their inventories, wholesalers can alternatively internalize retail orders, resulting in an unbalanced Mroib on the opposite side of the imbalance in institutional order flow. We next provide confirming evidence that Mroib imbalances indeed reflect wholesaler responses to high institutional demand for liquidity by relating M roib to institutional order flow imbalances; institutional trading costs and price pressure; and internalization costs.

# 6.2 Mroib, Institutional Trading, and Liquidity

Table 4 summarizes the relationships between Mroibvol and various contemporaneous outcomes across deciles of M roibvol. Close-to-close returns rise monotonically from $- 2$ bps in the bottom Mroibvol decile to 30bps in the top decile. However, this pattern is not due to price pressure from retail order flow. To show this, we decompose daily returns into intraday and overnight components. We find that intraday returns fall monotonically from 10bps in the bottom Mroibvol decile to $- 1 4$ bps in the top decile.46 As most internalized (priceimproved) trades are market and marketable-limit orders, the negative association between M roibvol and intraday returns is inconsistent with retail price pressure. This negative association is also at odds with informed retail trading, which would require a negative price impact of “informed” orders submitted by retail investors.

In sharp contrast to intraday returns, overnight returns are positively related to M roibvol. The signs of intraday and overnight returns differ for eight of the ten M roibvol deciles, in particular for the more extreme, unbalanced Mroibvol deciles. We next investigate a host of trading outcomes to understand these patterns.

Table 4 shows that trade imbalances from both long-only institutional investors and short sellers are, like intraday returns, negatively related to M roibvol. Average institutional flow falls from 27.7% in the bottom decile to 17.2% in the top decile. Moreover, short selling activity also occurs on the opposite side of internalized retail order flow as increased short interest (increased short selling) is associated with larger positive internalized retail order flow imbalances. Importantly, directional (as opposed to liquidity providing) short sellers, whose aggregate positions are reflected in short interest data, are known to be informed (Desai et al. 2002; Engelberg et al. 2013; Boehmer and Wu 2013). The negative association between such short selling activity and Mroibvol represents further evidence against the informativeness of retail orders executed at sub-pennies. Instead, these findings point to institutional price pressure driving intraday price movements.

We next show that the negative association between Mroib and institutional trade imbalance does not reflect incorrectly signed institutional trades picked up by BJZZ’s algorithm (Battalio et al. 2022b). TAQ data contain ANcerno-reported institutional trades, including those with sub-penny price increments that the algorithm picks up. Battalio et al. suggest the algorithm incorrectly signs 80% of those trades. To address the possibility that M roib imbalances simply reflect mistakenly-included institutional trade imbalances on the opposite side, we apply the algorithm to execution prices of ANcerno trades to construct BJZZ-implied institutional trade imbalances in ANcerno data. If our results reflect mis-classified institutional trades that enter M roib, then BJZZ-implied institutional trade imbalances must be positively related to Mroib. Table 4 shows this imbalance is negative on average, while the analogue for actual institutional imbalance is positive. This is consistent with Battalio et al.’s finding in their sample that the algorithm signs most institutional trades incorrectly. More importantly, BJZZ-implied institutional trade imbalances exhibit no discernible pattern in M roib, establishing that M roib’s negative correlation with ANcerno institutional trade imbalances is a robust feature. Section 7.4 provides additional robustness analyses.

We next show that extreme values of M roibvol are associated with less liquid markets. To do this, we first construct a stock-specific measure of abnormal realized off-exchange institutional liquidity. For each stock-day, we divide the volume of large off-exchange mid-point executions $^ { 4 7 }$ by the average of this quantity over the sample period for that stock. Higher values of this measure indicate greater midpoint liquidity. The bottom row in Table 4 shows that the prevalence of block trades executed off-exchange at the quote midpoint on ATSs is abnormally low when Mroibvol is more extreme. Extreme Mroibvol is associated with the abnormally lowest off-exchange midpoint execution, indicating that large internalized retail order flow imbalances are more common when off-exchange liquidity is abnormally scarce. Together with imbalances in institutional liquidity demand, this finding indicates that institutional investors have trouble locating counter-parties with whom to trade at the midpoint.

Liquidity is also scarce on exchanges when Mroibvol is more extreme. Table 4 shows that spreads are widest and depth at the NBBO is lowest for the extreme deciles of Mroibvol, where $\lvert M r o i b v o l \rvert$ is highest. Specifically, median price impacts per \$1m transaction for the average stock are 19bps and 22bps for the lowest and highest Mroibvol deciles, respectively. In contrast, balanced M roibvol is associated with only 3bps of such costs. Moreover, strikingly, average dollar and relative quoted spreads in the lowest and highest Mroibvol deciles are roughly double those when Mroibvol is relatively balanced.

The lack of mid-point liquidity on ATSs means that institutional investors with pressing liquidity needs must turn to venues where they are more likely to trade with HFMMs as intermediaries. By turning to a wholesaler’s SDP, an institution can opt to trade against a single HFMM, i.e., the wholesaler, concealing its presence. If, instead, an institutional investor opts for an exchange, then the wholesalers’ exclusive access to segmented retail flow as a source of inventory management provides them a competitive advantage over other HFMMs, making them more willing to fill institutional orders, which also results in an unbalanced M roibvol.

Importantly, most executions on SDPs and exchanges take place at the NBBO. In turn, since spreads are wider due to the lack of liquidity, filling institutional demands is unusually lucrative. This suggests that wholesalers may be willing to pay more than normal to internalize retail trade to fill those unusually lucrative institutional orders. Indeed, the ratio of internalized retail trades executed at prices that are superior to the NBBO by $1 \Phi$ or more rises by 33% as Mroibvol goes from intermediate levels to the two extremes (also see Section 7.4). That is, wholesalers exhibit a higher appetite for more costly internalization on one side of the market when institutional liquidity demand on the opposite side is abnormally high.

Reverse causality cannot explain these findings—it cannot be the case that wholesalers simply choose to fill more institutional orders to offset imbalances in the retail order flow that they internalize. For this mechanism to dominate, the liquidity available to institutions must improve when Mroib is extreme, since wholesalers would need to attract institutional flow by offering abnormally high ATS midpoint liquidity or by improving quoted prices and depth on exchanges. So, too, an abnormal abundance of retail trading interest on one side of the market would suggest that wholesalers may internalize retail orders on that side with minimal PI. However, Table 4 reveals that the exact opposite patterns obtain—high Mroib is associated with both higher institutional trading costs and higher internalization costs.

Our collective findings therefore allow us to attribute the negative association between intraday returns and M roib to institutional price pressure that occurs in the opposite direction of Mroib imbalances. As such, we reconcile the opposing patterns in overnight returns as price reversals following the institutional price pressure over each preceding intraday window.

Note that Table 4 also reveals that intraday and overnight returns in the extreme Mroibvol deciles reflect more than the immediate unwinding of price pressure. Most obviously, price pressure from institutional buying is 0.098% in M roibvol’s bottom decile, but the contemporaneous overnight reversal of −0.116% is even larger. To study these phenomena more precisely, we construct a 5-day overnight return that omits the first close-to-open return and adds the overnight return on the sixth day. This adjustment aligns the timing of intraday price pressure and overnight reversals. This adjustment exacerbates the disconnect between the intraday “price pressure” and the subsequent (next-day) overnight “reversals” that average $- 0 . 1 3 4 \%$ when Mroibvol is in decile 1. In fact, comparing intraday and “nextday” overnight returns when Mroibvol is in decile 1 versus decile 5 reveals differences of $0 . 0 9 8 - ( - 0 . 0 6 3 ) = 0 . 1 6 1 \%$ and $- 0 . 0 1 3 8 - 0 . 2 5 7 = - 0 . 3 7 9 \%$ , respectively. The analogous differences when Mroibvol is in decile 10 versus decile 5 are $- 0 . 1 3 8 - ( - 0 . 0 6 3 ) = - 0 . 0 7 5 \%$ and $0 . 4 5 6 - 0 . 2 5 7 = 0 . 1 9 9 \%$ . Thus, weekly overnight returns revert by far more than is needed to offset intraday returns, especially when Mroibvol is extremely negative. In Section 7.1, we reconcile this pattern by establishing that institutional buy order flow is more persistent than institutional sell order flow. As a result, institutional buy order flow predicts returns and, in turn, is predicted by retail imbalance (with an inverse relation) over longer horizons.

# 6.3 Return Predictability of Mroib: Initial Analysis

In this section, we formally examine the return predictability of M roib. Our findings are inconsistent with M roib capturing informed retail order flow. In contrast, near-term future weekly returns conditional on M roib are consistent with price reversals following liquidity consumption by institutional investors.

Panel B in Table 1 provides summary statistics that closely match those in Table I of BJZZ, confirming that our construction of M toibtrd and M roibvol parallels theirs.48 We estimate the predictability of weekly returns conditional on Mroibvol by estimating:

$$
R _ { j , w + i } = c _ { w } ^ { 0 } + c _ { w } ^ { 1 } M r o i b v o l _ { j , w - 1 } + { c _ { w } ^ { 2 } } ^ { \top } \mathrm { c o n t r o l s } _ { j , w - 1 } + u _ { j , w + i } ,
$$

where $R _ { j , w + i } ~ \in ~ \{ C C R _ { j , w + i } , I D R _ { j , w + i } , O N R _ { j , w + i } \}$ denotes weekly (rolling 5-day) close-toclose, intraday, and overnight returns, respectively, of stock $j$ in week $w + i$ . M roibvolj,w−1 denotes the imbalance in the trading volume of internalized retail order flow receiving price improvement in the previous week. We estimate equation (2) both unconditionally and conditional on the sign of $M r o i b v o l _ { j , w - 1 }$ to examine its return predictability separately when this order flow imbalance is negative and positive. Control variables include the previous week’s return $( R _ { w - 1 }$ ) in percentage points, the previous month’s return ( $R E T _ { - 1 }$ ), the return over the five months prior to the last month $\left( R E T _ { ( - 7 , - 2 ) } \right)$ , return volatility (VOLAT), as well as the natural logs of turnover (ln(TO)), market capitalization (ln(Size)), and book-to-market ratio (ln(BM)). As in BJZZ, we estimate equation (2) using Fama-Macbeth regressions, featuring Newey-West corrected standard errors with 6 lags.

Table 5 presents estimation results for week $i = 0$ . The second column corresponds to the second column of Table III in BJZZ. Our point estimate ( $\hat { c } _ { w } ^ { 1 }$ ) of 0.087% is nearly identical to their estimate of 0.09%. Coefficients on control variables are also similar to BJZZ’s estimates.

We now extend the analysis in three ways. First, we estimate the weekly return predictability of $M r o i b v o l _ { j , w - 1 }$ for up to 60 weeks ahead (past the 12 weeks in BJZZ). Second, we estimate return predictability conditional on the sign of $M r o i b v o l _ { j , w - 1 }$ . Third, we decompose returns entering the left-hand-side of equation (2) into intraday and overnight components.

Striking evidence obtains. As Figure 3 illustrates, the coefficients on $M r o i b v o l _ { j , w - 1 }$ become uniformly negative after 39 weeks. This is inconsistent with informed retail trading, but consistent with return dynamics reflecting pricing errors (Hendershott et al. 2021). The farfuture return reversals are also consistent with the positive association between M roib and changes in short interest documented in Table 4. As established by the literature, increased short interest (associated with higher M roib) predicts lower future returns, while decreased short interest (associated with lower M roib) predicts higher future returns (Desai et al. 2002; Engelberg et al. 2013; Boehmer and Wu 2013). Moreover, although a negative $M r o i b v o l _ { j , w - 1 }$ yields a positive coefficient for the current week’s close-to-close return ( $i = 0$ ), this coefficient declines and becomes negative by week $w + 6$ , contrary to retail sell orders being informed, as “retail sell order flow” realizes weekly losses due to persistent price appreciation after 6

Figure 3: Internalized Order Flow and the Cross-sections of Future Weekly Returns. This figure shows the associations between $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ and future week $w + i$ returns (in $\%$ ), with $i \in \{ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 1 2 , 2 4 , 3 6 , 3 9 , 4 2 , 4 5 , 4 8 , 5 1 , 5 4 , 5 7 , 6 0 \}$ . Returns reflect the quoted mid-points at the close. According to equation (2), week $w + i$ returns in each sample are regressed on $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ , whose loadings are plotted in future weeks for both the unconditional analysis and the analysis conditional on the sign of $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ . The estimated loadings are from Fama-Macbeth regressions, featuring Newey-West standard errors with 6 lags. Statistically significant and insignificant $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ loadings at the $1 0 \%$ type one error are identified by filled and hollow markers, respectively. The sample includes NMS common shares from January 2010 to December 2014, excluding observations when the previous month-end’s closing price is below $\$ 1$ .

![](images/495c17b175930a7c85348aabe53f7d2139810a1d351ef932602b7d6f6b20a862.jpg)

weeks. In contrast, a positive $M r o i b v o l _ { j , w - 1 }$ always yields a positive coefficient for weekly returns across all horizons (see Internet Appendix B for tabulated results).

Decomposing returns into intraday and overnight components uncovers further asymmetries in the loadings conditional on the sign of $M r o i b v o l _ { j , w - 1 }$ . For overnight returns, $\hat { c } _ { w } ^ { 1 }$ is positive following negative $M r o i b v o l _ { j , w - 1 }$ (retail selling, institutional buying), but negative and insignificant following positive $M r o i b v o l _ { j , w - 1 }$ (retail buying, institutional selling). Barclay and Hendershott (2003) and Jiang et al. (2012), among others, show that overnight price movements are information-driven. However, the insignificant negative relation between net retail buying imbalances and next week’s overnight returns indicates that retail buys are not informed.49 Moreover, informed retail trading cannot explain why $\hat { c } _ { w } ^ { 1 }$ switches sign for intraday returns when $M r o i b v o l _ { j , w - 1 }$ switches sign.50

Investigating Mroibvol’s dynamics provides further evidence that Mroib does not reflect informed directional retail trading. This analysis is motivated by BJZZ’s finding that M roib persists over time—their regression of weekly Mroibvol on lagged Mroibvol yields a coefficient of 0.22 (BJZZ, p. 2265). BJZZ use a linear model to estimate the dynamics of Mroibvol. We show that such a model is mis-specified—their assumed $A R ( 1 )$ process fails to capture the heterogeneity in the dynamics of retail imbalances. To show this we adopt a non-parametric approach to estimate the distribution of Mroibvol in week $w + i$ conditional on week $w - 1$ .

Panel A in Figure 5 reveals that stock-weeks with extreme negative and extreme positive Mroibvol quantities in week $w - 1$ also tend to have extreme imbalances in week $w + 1 2$ . This pattern also holds more generally for different weeks $w + i$ . Crucially, stocks with extremely negative Mroibvol in week $w - 1$ are likely to have extremely negative or positive Mroibvol in week $w + 1 2$ . Put differently, extreme retail selling “pressure” predicts both extreme retail selling and extreme retail buying “pressure” 13 weeks forward. So, too, stocks with extremely positive Mroibvol in week $w - 1$ are likely to have extremely positive or negative Mroibvol in week $w + 1 2$ .51 To show these findings are inconsistent with a linear formulation of M roib’s persistence, we use simulated data from an $A R ( 1 )$ process as a benchmark—Panel B in Figure 5 shows that very different non-parametric estimates obtain from those in Panel A.

Our findings suggest that a large absolute M roib is a stock characteristic. A non-trivial set of stocks systematically experience large imbalances in internalized retail order flow that alternate between net buy and net sell. Interpreting Mroib as a manifestation of directional informed retail trading would require these stocks to fluctuate systematically in the direction of informed trading. In contrast, these patterns are consistent with Barardehi et al. (2022)’s finding that $| M r o i b |$ is a persistent stock-level proxy for illiquidity.

# 7 Why Does Mroib Predict Returns?

In this section, we report how wholesaler liquidity provision to institutional investors is responsible for the return predictability of M roib. Specifically, we attribute this return predictability to the unwinding of institutional price pressure.

# 7.1 Dynamics of Institutional and Retail Order Flows

In Section 6.2, we documented that overnight reversals exceeded intraday price pressure (in the same week). This section reconciles this phenomenon by showing that overnight reversals also reflect the unwinding of institutional price pressure accumulated in prior weeks. This effect is more salient when more retail sell orders have been internalized, presumably to provide liquidity for institutional buy orders.

To show this, we estimate

$$
\begin{array} { r c l } { { X _ { j , w } } } & { { = } } & { { \displaystyle a ^ { 0 } + \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { 6 } a _ { i } ^ { 1 } I n o i b v o l _ { j , w - i } + \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { 6 } a _ { i } ^ { 2 } \left[ I ( I n o i b v o l _ { j , w - i } < 0 ) \right] } } \\ { { } } & { { + } } & { { \displaystyle \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { 6 } a _ { i } ^ { 3 } \left[ I ( I n o i b v o l _ { j , w - i } < 0 ) \times I n o i b v o l _ { j , w - i } \right] + \epsilon _ { j , w } , } } \end{array}
$$

where $X \in \{ I n o i b v o l , M r o i b v o l \}$ ; and $I ( \cdot )$ is an indicator function that equals 1 if Inoibvol < 0 and equals 0 otherwise. The models are estimated using Fama-MacBeth regressions, with standard errors corrected using the Newey-West methodology with 6 lags. On average across stocks, ANcerno covers less than 7% of the total daily trading volume reported by CRSP.52 To reduce the noise attributable to a lack of coverage we use the subset of stocks for which the share of ANcerno-reported volume relative to CRSP is above-average.

Columns (1)–(4) in Table 6 present the AR( $k$ ) estimates for Inoibvol, showing that past positive and negative institutional trade imbalances, especially those for institutional buying, predict current institutional trade imbalances differently. The most recent week’s positive and negative Inoibvol predict current week’s Inoibvol similarly, with point estimates of 0.33 and 0.35 for positive and negative $I n o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ , respectively. However, these coefficients sharply diverge for $k > 1$ , where the loadings of negative $I n o i b v o l _ { w - i }$ become 30-70% smaller than those on their positive $I n o i b v o l _ { w - i }$ counterparts. This finding is consistent with a literature that finds long-only fund managers accumulate long positions slowly, but sell quickly, largely to fund purchases.53 This persistent institutional buying drives the accumulation of positive price pressure whose unwinding extends beyond the subsequent close-to-open to subsequent days, while institutional selling is less persistent.

Columns (5)–(8) in Table 6 highlight how past institutional trade imbalances predict future internalized retail order flow, reinforcing our earlier conclusion that wholesalers intermediate trades between institutional and retail investors. Consistent with the stronger auto-correlation for institutional buying, and retail sell orders being internalized to provide liquidity for institutional buy orders, $I n o i b v o l _ { w - i }$ loads with negative and significant coefficients.54 Mirroring the weaker auto-correlation in institutional trade imbalances when $I n o i b v o l _ { w - i } < 0$ , the loadings for $I n o i b v o l _ { w - i }$ become positive for $k > 2$ . These dynamics indicate that the most negative $M r o i b v o l _ { w }$ observations, i.e., those in decile 1 of Table 4, are disproportionately more likely to arise following persistent institutional buying pressure whose unwinding makes the current week’s overnight returns more negative.

These statistical findings contain insights about institutions’ demand for retail sourced liquidity. The negative correlation between past positive institutional trade imbalances and current internalized retail order flow is consistent with institutions resorting to retail-sourced liquidity, provided by wholesalers, especially in less liquid markets.

# 7.2 Institutional Trading and Short-Term Return Predictability

We next establish that M roib’s short-term return predictability is a liquidity-driven phenomenon. Due to the persistence of institutional liquidity demand, especially institutional buying, overnight price reversals associated with extreme Mroibvol magnitudes extend into future weeks. This creates distinguishable differences between close-to-close returns that follow extremely negative and extremely positive internalized retail order flow imbalances.

To highlight the persistence of institutional liquidity demand, we estimate

$$
\begin{array} { l l l } { { { I n o i b v o l } _ { j , w } } } & { { = } } & { { \displaystyle { c ^ { 0 } + \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { 6 } c _ { i } ^ { 1 } M r o i b v o l _ { j , w - i } + \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { 6 } c _ { i } ^ { 2 } \left[ I ( I n o i b v o l _ { j , w - i } < 0 ) \right] } } } \\ { { } } & { { + } } & { { \displaystyle { \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { 6 } c _ { i } ^ { 3 } \left[ I ( I n o i b v o l _ { j , w - i } < 0 ) \times M r o i b v o l _ { j , w - i } \right] + \epsilon _ { j , w } } . } } \end{array}
$$

Variable definitions and estimation approaches are identical to those in equation (3). Table 7 shows that the first and second lags of internalized retail order flow load with significantly negative coefficients when these lagged internalized order flows correspond to positive institutional flow. That is, when institutional buy pressure is higher, the greater internalization of retail sell orders relative to buy orders is associated with abnormally high institutional buy pressure for up to two weeks ahead. This persistence drives subsequent abnormally negative overnight returns, due to reversals after institutional price pressure that skew future weeks’ close-to-close returns downward. Thus, while M roibvol seems to predict future close-to-close returns, this just reflects price reversals following institutional buy pressure.

# 7.3 Long-Term Return Predictability and Liquidity Premia

This section revisits the return predictability of M roibvol to offer a unifying explanation for the patterns found in Section 6.3. We analyze Mroibvol’s long-term return predictability, especially cross-sectional return differences after conditioning on the sign of $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ .

We provide evidence consistent with extreme Mroibvol stocks being less liquid, and hence requiring greater liquidity premia, as found by Barardehi et al. (2022).

Table 8 documents the relationships between close-to-close, intraday, and overnight weekly returns conditional on $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ . Consistent with $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ ’s short-term return predictability, close-to-close returns for week $w$ rise with increases in $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ . Most of the return variation is concentrated in the extreme deciles (deciles 1, 9, and 10). Furthermore, consistent with $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ ’s declining impact on close-to-close returns in Table B.1, the return difference between the bottom and top deciles of $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ falls rapidly over time, nearly disappearing by week $w + 1 2$ . Instead, a striking ∪-shaped pattern in close-to-close returns across $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ deciles emerges at week $w + 3$ , strengthening sharply in subsequent weeks. For example, average week $w + 1 2$ ’s close-to-close returns in deciles 1 and 10 of $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ (0.15% and $0 . 1 8 \%$ , respectively) are more than double that in decile 6 (0.07%). This ∪-shaped pattern holds in all future weeks—future returns are inversely related to negative $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ and positively related to positive $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ . These distinct relationships reinforce the earlier negative and positive coefficients from regressing future weekly returns on negative and positive $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ , respectively (see Figure 3 and Table B.1).

We next relate the ∪-shaped pattern in longer future returns to liquidity premia. A liquidity premium associated with expected trading costs as a stock characteristic implies long-term return differences according to the level of liquidity. The strong association between liquidity measures, institutional trading costs, and retail order flow internalization suggests that stocks with more extreme $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ are less liquid. Hence, these stocks should command higher permanent expected return (higher cross-sectional returns) as compensation that institutional investors require to hold less liquid assets (where entering and exiting positions is costlier), as Amihud and Mendelson (1986) first argued. To make clear that liquidity premia drive the long-term ∪-shaped pattern in returns, we focus on lower $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ deciles, where Section 7.2 provided evidence that the negative relationship between near-term returns and $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ in lower Mroibvol deciles likely reflect extended price reversals of price pressure from previously-accumulated long institutional positions.55 It is clear that this negative relationship is temporary and is eventually dominated by the positive cross-sectional effect due to liquidity premia.

Decomposing close-to-close returns into intraday and overnight components lets us identify when liquidity premia are realized during the day and contribute to the recent asset pricing literature documenting time-of-day return disparities that are important to asset pricing anomalies. Consistent with these findings, our decomposition of close-to-close returns reveals that the ∪-shaped pattern in future close-to-close returns as $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ rises from low deciles to high are largely attributable to intraday returns. In fact, overnight returns follow a ∩-shaped pattern in $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ . Attributing the ∪-shaped pattern in intraday returns to liquidity premia provides an economic mechanism that reconciles why intraday and overnight return anomalies differ. In particular, liquidity premia are realized only when there is trade.

In Internet Appendix C, we decompose Mroib into persistence, contrarian trading and residual components as in BJZZ, investigating the sources of M roib’s return predictability. We attribute Mroib’s long-term predictive power solely to the residual component, finding that both extreme negative and extreme positive residuals are associated with higher future returns. These findings further confirm liquidity-driven explanations of return predictability.

# 7.4 Implications of the Size of Price Improvement

To provide further support for how wholesaler choices drive Mroib imbalances, we now delve more deeply into the link between institutional liquidity demand and the magnitudes of sub-penny price improvements that wholesalers offer when internalizing retail orders. We show that stronger institutional demand for liquidity, as manifested by more extreme institutional trade imbalance and price impacts, is associated with more costly internalization, i.e., internalized retail orders not only with larger sub-penny price improvements but also a higher probability of execution at prices inside the NBBO by over $1 \Phi$ .

Figure 6 plots the histogram of sub-penny price improvements associated with internalized retail trades, as identified by BJZZ’s algorithm. Over 80% of sub-penny PIs are at 0.01 $\Phi$ , 0.1 $\Phi$ , 0.2¢, 0.25¢, 0.3¢, or 0.4¢ increments, suggesting that simple informal agreements govern price improvement schedules. More importantly, we find that (1) the size of price improvement is positively related to the bid-ask spread; (2) the sub-penny increments of PIs are larger when internalized orders are executed inside the NBBO by over $1 \Phi$ ; and (3) more frequent such inside-quote internalization is associated with wider bid-ask spreads.

We first observe that BJZZ’s algorithm, which does not require the use of quote data, incorrectly signs some buy retail trades as sells, and vice versa. We describe the source of mis-classification with an example: suppose the NBB and NBO are \$9.97 and $\$ 10.03$ , and a marketable buy order placed at $\$ 10.03$ is executed at $\$ 10.013$ . BJZZ’s algorithm observes the sub-penny increment of $0 . 3 \Phi$ and signs this transaction as a sell, but the trade is actually a buy receiving price improvement of 1.7¢. As Section 6.2 notes, Battalio et al. (2022b) show that many trade mis-classifications reflect the algorithm’s inclusion of some institutional trades.

Matching each transaction with the corresponding NBBO and comparing execution prices against quote midpoints yields estimates for the share of incorrectly-signed trades by subpenny increment. Panel B in Figure 6 shows that this share rises sharply with the distance of the sub-penny increment from the nearest full penny. Importantly, an unreported robustness analysis reveals that all of our main findings continue to hold when we correct for the mis-classification of trades, likely because our aggregation to the weekly level mitigates the largely idiosyncratic nature of mis-classified buy and sell trades. Complementing our findings in Section 6.2, this robustness finding indicates that imbalances in sub-penny executed institutional trades not reported by ANcerno do not drive the variation in M roib.

We next document a strong relation between the size of sub-penny increment of PIs and the likelihood that the corresponding execution takes place inside the NBBO by over $1 \Phi$ . This finding is robust to removing mis-classified retail trades from the sample. As Panels A and C in Figure 6 illustrate, the share of internalized retail orders whose execution price is at least $1 \Phi$ better than the NBBO at the time of transaction rises sharply with the size of sub-penny PI increment. For example, after removing mis-classified trades, this share goes from about 5% to over 50% as the sub-penny increment of PI goes from 0.01 $\Phi$ (0.99 $\Phi$ ) to $0 . 4 \Phi$ (0.6¢). Moreover, Panel D of Figure 6 shows that both larger sub-penny PI increments and more frequent inside-quote executions are associated with wider bid-ask spreads. Overall, our findings suggest that wholesalers are willing to spend more PFOF $+$ PI to internalize orders in less liquid markets. We next show that the imbalance in these more costly internalized orders is more strongly related to institutional trading costs than the imbalance in the less costly internalized orders, highlighting the economic motives that justify such costlier internalization.

Figure 6 shows that the median sub-penny price improvement is $0 . 1 \Phi$ . This leads us to construct two versions of M roibvol, one for internalized retail orders with “small” sub-penny PI increments of less than 0.1¢ and one for “large” such increments of at least $0 . 1 \Phi$ .56 We then compare institutional trading outcomes, price impacts, institutional trade imbalances, intraday returns (proxy for institutional price pressure), and overnight return (proxy for the unwinding of institutional price pressure), across the two versions of M roibvol.

Panel A in Figure 7 shows that price impacts display far stronger ∪-shaped patterns for high-sub-penny Mroibvol than for low-sub-penny Mroibvol. That is, the most extreme highsub-penny Mroibvol observations occur when institutional trading costs are highest. This result reinforces that the unbalanced internalization of retail orders that are more costly to internalize, due to large price improvements, occurs when wholesalers provide liquidity to institutions willing to incur larger price impacts to locate liquidity. Panel B provides further evidence of this mechanism, showing a sharp inverse relationship between institutional trade imbalances and high-sub-penny Mroibvol, highlighting how institutional liquidity demand drives the unbalanced and costly internalization of retail orders on the opposite side. In contrast, institutional trade imbalance is weakly ∪-shaped conditional on low-sub-penny Mroibvol. Building on these insights, Panels C and D show that as high-sub-penny Mroibvol rises, intraday returns fall from 10bps to −30bps while overnight returns reverse in the opposite direction. That is, high-sub-penny M roibvol is associated with institutional price pressure followed by overnight reversals. In contrast, with small-sub-penny M roibvol, returns mirror the weak ∪-shaped pattern in institutional trade imbalances.

# 8 Conclusion

In U.S. equity markets, wholesalers exercise order flow segmentation by purchasing the right to handle retail order flow from retail brokers. Wholesalers possess discretion over which orders to internalize and which orders to re-route to other trading venues. A wholesaler also acts as a HFMM on exchanges, ATSs, and its own SDP where it interacts with institutional investors. Wholesalers’ exclusive access to internalized retail order flow equips them with a unique resource for inventory management when providing liquidity to institutional investors, giving wholesalers a competitive advantage over other liquidity providers.

Order flow segmentation in U.S. equity markets precludes direct interactions between retail and institutional orders. Our paper is the first to identify a mechanism through which wholesalers exploit segmentation by internalizing retail orders to provide liquidity to institutions, especially when liquidity is scarce. We also shed light on how wholesaler economic choices underlie the return predictability of observable imbalanced in internalized retail trades (denoted Mroib by BJZZ).

In a nutshell, we find that the variation in Mroib reflects a symptom of wholesalers’ inventory management in the face of large variation in institutional liquidity demand. In turn, the return predictability of M roib reflects the price dynamics that follow this variation. To fill unbalanced institutional liquidity demand, wholesalers internalize unequal amounts of buy and sell retail order flow, causing M roib to be inversely related to institutional trade imbalances and large in absolute value. We show that the absolute value of Mroib is largest when institutional liquidity is most costly—when institutional price impacts are highest, spreads are widest, depth at NBBO is lowest, and mid-point off-exchange liquidity on ATSs is lowest. Institutional price pressure drives intraday returns, causing intraday returns to be inversely related to M roib. In turn, M roib’s short-term predictive power for weekly returns reflects price reversals following institutional price pressure. In the longer term, future returns are ∪-shaped in Mroib, indicating that $| M r o i b |$ captures stock-specific expected trading costs for which institutional traders demand higher permanent expected returns.

Panel B reports summary statistics for daily measures of internalized order flows for our sample of NYSE-, AMEX-, and NASDAQ-listed common shares during the 2010–2014 period. Mrbvol and Mrsvol denote trading volumes for internalized trades classified as retail buy and retail sell, respectively. Mrbtrd and Mrstrd denote the number of internalized trades classified as retail buy and retail sell, respectively. M roibvol and Mroibtrd then denote normalized imbalances in internalized retail order flow based on trading volume and trade frequency, respectively.

Table 4 : Portfolios of Mroibvol : Contemporaneous Return, Liquidity, Institutional Trading, and Short Interest . The t able presents the cross-sectional relationship between weekly Mroi bvol and the contemporaneous return , institutional trade , and liquidity outcomes . Outcome variables include ( 1 ) returns (close-to-close , intraday, and overnight returns , with a version of overnight returns shifted by one day) ; (2) liquidity (dollar and relative quoted spreads , depth, in shares , and abnormal off-exchange midpoint executions of larger trades) ; (3) institutional trading (actual trade imbalance , institutional price impact (in bps/ $\$ 10$ ) , and BJZZ-implied trade imbalance) ; and (4) short interest ( $\%$ change in bi-weekly short interest ) . Each weekly cross-section is sorted into deciles of Mroibvol . The average of an outcome variable $Y$ is calculated by Mroi bvol decile in each cross-section before the averages of mean- $Y$ time-series are calculated . For short interest , bi-weekly relative $\%$ changes in short interest are constructed and Mroibvol is aggregated over two-week periods , before forming Mroibvol portfolios . Median short interest changes by Mroi bvol and stock size tercile , before averaging the time-series of medians .

Table 5 : Internalized Retail Order Flow and the Cross-section of Next Week’s Returns . This table presents estimates of the association between internalized ret ail order flow and the cross-section of the next week ’ s returns (in percent age points) . Daily returns are calculated based on the mid-points of best bid and ask prices at close as well as open prices , decomposing each day ’ s close-to-close returns into intraday (open-to-close) and overnight (close-to-open) before aggregating each return type into weekly observations . Each of the three return cross-sections is decomposed based on the sign of previous week’ s internalized order flow to form a total of nine samples . According to equation (2) , week $w$ returns in each sample are regressed on week $w - 1$ ’ s internalized order flows $( M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 } )$ ) and control variables including last week ’ s return $\left( R _ { w - 1 } \right)$ , last month ’ s return $( R E T _ { - 1 }$ ) , the return over the preceding five months $( R E T _ { ( - 7 , - 2 ) } )$ , volatility (VOLAT) , and natural logs of turnover (ln (TO ) ) , market capitalization (ln ( Size) ) , and book-to-market ratio (ln (BM) ) . Estimates are based on Fama-Macbeth regressions , featuring Newey-West corrected standard errors with 6 lags . Sample includes NMS common shares from Jan 20 1 0 – Dec 20 14 , excluding observations with previous month-end ’s closing price below $\$ 1$ .

# A Wholesaler Incentives, Mroib, and Institutional Liquidity

In this section, we provide a setting to illustrate the economic incentives underlying a wholesaler’s decisions about which retail orders to internalize, and the consequences for $M r o i b$ . We focus on a setting where the wholesaler faces variable costs of internalization due to the possibility of internalizing both marketable and non-marketable orders. Similar economic considerations arise in a framework where internalization of marketable orders is sometimes more costly as a result of inside quote hidden liquidity (due to the Manning rule).

Suppose that the public information value of a share is $V$ , and there is a four tick spread. Thus, the bid is $\ S ( V - 2 t )$ and the ask is $\mathbb { S } ( V + 2 t )$ . The distribution of retail orders routed by the broker-dealer to a wholesaler is given by

• $n _ { - 2 } ^ { s }$ marketable sell orders at $\ S ( V - 2 t )$ • $n _ { - 1 } ^ { s }$ limit sell orders at $\ S ( V - t )$ • $n _ { 0 } ^ { s }$ limit sell orders and $n _ { 0 } ^ { b }$ limit buy orders at $\$ V$ • $n _ { 1 } ^ { b }$ limit buy orders at $\mathbb { S } ( V + t )$ • $n _ { 2 } ^ { b }$ marketable buy orders at $\mathbb { S } ( V + 2 t )$

To illustrate the economics, suppose there is more retail sell interest than retail buy interest so that $n _ { - j } ^ { s } \ge n _ { j } ^ { b }$ , for $j = 0 , 1 , 2$ , and we define $\Delta _ { j } = n _ { - j } ^ { s } - n _ { j } ^ { b } \ge 0$ . To reduce the number of cases that we need to enumerate, we assume that (a) $n _ { - 2 } ^ { s } \leq n _ { 2 } ^ { b } + n _ { 1 } ^ { b }$ , and (b) $n _ { - 2 } ^ { s } + n _ { - 1 } ^ { s } \leq n _ { 2 } ^ { b } + n _ { 1 } ^ { b } + n _ { 0 } ^ { b }$ . Qualitatively similar implications obtain when these assumptions do not hold.

The wholesaler chooses whether to internalize a retail order in return for giving the broker-dealer PFOF, or to reroute it directly to an exchange, in which case all rebates (or fees) go to the retail broker, where the rebate for liquidity-making limit orders exceeds that for liquidity-taking market orders.57 The broker-dealer obtains $P F O F _ { j }$ in return for outsourcing the execution of a type $j$ order to the wholesaler.

Price improvement of $P I _ { M } > 0$ is offered to marketable orders in order to satisfy best execution duties. For simplicity, we assume that fraction $\alpha _ { N M } \geq 0$ of non-marketable orders receive price improvement of $P I _ { N M } > 0$ . As we show, a large share of trade executions with sub-penny price improvements are inside the NBBO, indicating that $\alpha _ { N M }$ is non-trivial. To ease presentation, we assume that the total PFOF plus PI offered is less than half a tick, so that it is profitable to intermediate buy and sell orders than are one tick apart.

It is costly for the wholesaler to hold inventory that deviates by $q$ from its preferred inventory level of 0. We assume that these costs rise convexly in $q$ , i.e., $c ( q ) - c ( q - 1 )$ is strictly increasing in $q$ , where $c ( 1 ) - c ( 0 )$ is assumed to be less than the expected liquidity rebate, consistent with tiny deviations from optimal inventory levels not being that costly.

We first highlight the economic forces for balanced levels of Mroib in the absence of institutional liquidity demand. When a wholesaler is not “pinged” by an institution, it is strictly profitable for the wholesaler to internalize marketable sell orders and limit sell orders at $\ S ( V - t )$ simultaneously with marketable buy orders and limit buy orders at $\mathbb { S } ( V + t )$ , as the PFOF plus PI paid is less than the profit obtained by intermediating these orders. Thus, at least $m i n \{ n _ { - 2 } ^ { s } + n _ { - 1 } ^ { s } , n _ { 2 } ^ { b } + n _ { 1 } ^ { b } \} = n _ { 2 } ^ { b } + n _ { 1 } ^ { b }$ is filled on each side by the wholesaler’s internalization. The BJZZ algorithm identifies the subset of those internalized orders that receives price improvement, which comprise a total of $2 ( n _ { 2 } ^ { b } + \alpha _ { N M } n _ { 1 } ^ { b } )$ .

After filling these orders, the distribution of the remaining retail orders is given by $\bullet$ $0$ marketable sell orders at $\ S ( V - 2 t )$ • $n _ { - 2 } ^ { s } + n _ { - 1 } ^ { s } - ( n _ { 2 } ^ { b } + n _ { 1 } ^ { b } )$ limit sell orders at $\ S ( V - t )$ • $n _ { 0 } ^ { s }$ limit sell orders and $n _ { 0 } ^ { b }$ limit buy orders at $\$ V$ • 0 limit buy orders at $\mathbb { S } ( V + t )$ • 0 marketable buy orders at $\mathbb { S } ( V + 2 t )$

Next observe that it is optimal for the wholesaler to internalize some of the remaining limit sell orders at $\ S ( V - t )$ by holding inventory, stopping at the inventory imbalance of $q ^ { * }$ where

$$
\begin{array} { r c l } { t - ( c ( q ^ { * } ) - c ( q ^ { * } - 1 ) ) } & { \geq } & { t - P F O F _ { 1 } - P F O F _ { 0 } - 2 \alpha _ { N M } P I _ { 1 } } \\ & & { > } & { t - ( c ( q ^ { * } + 1 ) - c ( q ^ { * } ) ) . } \end{array}
$$

That is, the wholesaler stops internalizing orders when the marginal profit from internalizing by holding more unbalanced inventory would be less than that from simultaneously filling

a non-marketable limit sell order at $\ S ( V - t )$ and a non-marketable limit buy order at $\$ V$ .   
Again, BJZZ’s algorithm identifies fraction $\alpha _ { N M }$ of these orders.

When $n _ { - 2 } ^ { s } + n _ { - 1 } ^ { s } - ( n _ { 2 } ^ { b } + n _ { 1 } ^ { b } ) > q ^ { * }$ , the wholesaler fills the remaining limit sell orders at $\ S ( V - t )$ with limit buy orders at $\$ V$ . The dealer then submits all remaining limit orders $^ { 5 8 }$ at $\$ V$ to exchanges. Thus, absent institutional liquidity demand, for $n _ { - 2 } ^ { s } + n _ { - 1 } ^ { s } \le n _ { 2 } ^ { b } + n _ { 1 } ^ { b } + q ^ { * }$ , internalization order imbalances identified by the BJZZ algorithm equal

$$
M r o i b v o l | = \frac { \left( n _ { 2 } ^ { s } + \alpha _ { N M } n _ { 1 } ^ { s } \right) - \left( n _ { - 2 } ^ { b } + \alpha _ { N M } n _ { - 1 } ^ { b } \right) } { n _ { 2 } ^ { b } + \alpha _ { N M } n _ { 1 } ^ { b } + n _ { - 2 } ^ { s } + \alpha _ { N M } n _ { - 1 } ^ { s } } = \frac { \Delta _ { 2 } + \alpha _ { N M } \Delta _ { 1 } } { n _ { 2 } ^ { b } + n _ { - 2 } ^ { s } + \alpha _ { N M } \left( n _ { 1 } ^ { b } + n _ { - 1 } ^ { s } \right) } .
$$

$\lvert M r o i b v o l \rvert$ reaches a maximum at $n _ { - 2 } ^ { s } + n _ { - 1 } ^ { s } = n _ { 2 } ^ { b } + n _ { 1 } ^ { b } + q ^ { * }$ , where substituting for $\Delta _ { 1 } =$ $q ^ { * } - \Delta _ { 2 }$ yields

$$
| M r o i b v o l | = \frac { \alpha _ { N M } q ^ { * } + ( 1 - \alpha _ { N M } ) \Delta _ { 2 } } { 2 ( n _ { 2 } ^ { b } + \alpha _ { N M } n _ { 1 } ^ { b } ) + \alpha _ { N M } q ^ { * } + ( 1 - \alpha _ { N M } ) \Delta _ { 2 } } .
$$

For $n _ { - 2 } ^ { s } + n _ { - 1 } ^ { s } > n _ { 2 } ^ { b } + n _ { 1 } ^ { b } + q ^ { * }$ , $\vert M r o i b v o l \vert$ falls with further increases in $n _ { - 1 } ^ { s }$ , as sell orders at $\$ 1$ are crossed with buy orders at $\$ V$ , while the denominator rises due to the “crossing” of the fraction $\alpha _ { N M }$ receiving price improvement. Thus, if $\alpha _ { N M } = 1$ , then a peak of

$$
| M r o i b v o l | = \frac { q ^ { * } } { 2 ( n _ { 2 } ^ { b } + n _ { 1 } ^ { b } ) + q ^ { * } }
$$

is reached, and if $\alpha _ { N M } = 0$ , then the peak is

$$
| M r o i b v o l | = \frac { q ^ { * } - \Delta _ { 1 } } { 2 n _ { 2 } ^ { b } + q ^ { * } - \Delta _ { 1 } }
$$

Thus, with no institutional liquidity demand, we predict that internalization of retail orders should be roughly balanced.

Now suppose there is significant institutional liquidity demand. Such demand, when non-zero, is likely large relative to retail order flow, reflecting the much larger positions that institutions take, and the fact that there is little point for an institution to ping a wholesaler for a small position. To highlight how institutional demand changes M roib measures, suppose now that there is extensive institutional sell demand in the setting above, where previously there were relatively small negative (sell) retail trade imbalances.

Internalized order flow is an expensive source of liquidity for institutions. To see why, first note the straightforward direct effect—an institution seeking to sell shares must compensate a wholesaler for the profits that the wholesaler would otherwise obtain by internalizing retail sell orders. More subtly, an institution must also compensate a wholesaler for the foregone possibility of using the internalized retail buy orders to profitably fill retail sell orders without distorting the wholesaler’s inventory—retail buy orders that are used to fill institutional sell orders cannot be used to fill retail sell orders. Finally, a wholesaler may have some bargaining power in negotiations with institutions. This logic implies that an institution interested in selling shares on an SDP must compensate the wholesaler via a combination of a low purchase price $p _ { s }$ and SDP access fees.

To begin suppose that the institution seeks to sell more than $n _ { 2 } ^ { b } + n _ { 1 } ^ { b } + n _ { 0 } ^ { b } + q _ { s } ^ { * }$ where

$$
\begin{array} { l l l } { V - p _ { s } - ( c ( q _ { s } ^ { * } ) - c ( q _ { s } ^ { * } - 1 ) ) } & { \geq } & { 0 } \\ & { > } & { V - p _ { s } - ( c ( q _ { s } ^ { * } + 1 ) - c ( q _ { s } ^ { * } ) ) . } \end{array}
$$

Then a wholesaler will internalize the retail buy orders received $( n _ { 2 } ^ { b } + n _ { 1 } ^ { b } + n _ { 0 } ^ { b } )$ to fill the institution’s sell orders, and continue to fill them via increasing its inventory only up to the point $\left( n _ { 2 } ^ { b } + n _ { 1 } ^ { b } + n _ { 0 } ^ { b } + q _ { s } ^ { \ast } \right)$ where the marginal profit from internalization exceeds the marginal increase in inventory costs. Now, all retail sell orders are rerouted to other trading venues so that, rather than being negative, Mroibvol takes on its maximum value of one.

From this point, as one reduces institutional sell demand, one eventually reaches the level $( n _ { 2 } ^ { b } + n _ { 1 } ^ { b } + n _ { 0 } ^ { b } + q _ { s } ^ { \ast } )$ below which a wholesaler now fills all of the institution’s orders. To do this, a wholesaler uses all retail buy orders while distorting its inventory to the minimum extent needed, and still reroutes all retail sell orders to trading venues. Thus, on this range, the marginal order is accommodated out of inventory, so $M r o i b v o l = 1$ , remaining maximally tilted in the opposite direction of true retail order flow imbalance, $\frac { \sum _ { j } \Delta _ { j } } { \sum _ { j } ( n _ { j } ^ { b } + n _ { - j } ^ { s } ) } < 0$

With further reductions, one reaches a level of institutional sell demand at which the marginal inventory cost just falls below the profit from filling a marketable retail sell order. At this point, a wholesaler starts to internalize marketable retail sell orders, causing $\lvert M r o i b v o l \rvert$ to begin to fall, as first more attractive retail sell limit orders are internalized, and then limit buy orders at $\$ V$ are rerouted to other trading venues instead of being internalized.

Taken together the observations with and without institutional liquidity demand reveal that (i) small Mroib imbalances are an indication of the absence or near absence of net institutional demand, while (ii) very large Mroib imbalances indicate unbalanced net institutional liquidity demand with the opposite sign of Mroib.

# B Mroib ’s Predictive Power for Future Returns

In this section we tabulate partial regression outputs underlying the fidndings reported in Figure 3 .

Table B . 1 : Internalized Order Flow and the Cross-sections of Future Weeks ’ Returns . This table presents estimates of the associations between internalized ret ail order flow and the cross-sections of future week $w + i$ returns (in percent age points) , with $i \in \{ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 1 2 , 2 4 , 3 6 , 3 9 , 4 2 , 4 5 , 4 8 , 5 1 , 5 4 , 5 7 , 6 0 \}$ . Daily returns are calculated based on the mid-points of best bid and ask prices at close as well as open prices , decomposing each day ’ s close-to-close returns into intraday (open-to-close) and overnight (close-to-open) before aggregating each return type into weekly observations . Each of the three return cross-sections for a given week $w + i$ is decomposed based on the sign of week $w - 1$ ’s internalized order flow to form a total of nine samples . According to equation ( 2 ) , week $w + i$ returns in each sample are regressed on week $w - 1$ ’ s internalized order flows $( M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 } )$ , whose loadings are reported in the t able , and control variables including last week ’ s return $\left( R _ { w - 1 } \right)$ , last month ’ s return $( R E T _ { - 1 } )$ , the return over the preceding five months $( R E T _ { ( - 7 , - 2 ) } )$ , volatility (VOLAT) , and natural logs of turnover (ln (TO ) ) , market capit alization (ln ( Size) ) , and book-to-market ratio (ln (BM) ) . Estimates are based Fama-Macbeth regressions , featuring Newey-West corrected standard errors with 6 lags . Sample includes NMS common shares from Jan 20 1 0 – Dec 20 14 , excluding observations with previous month-end ’s closing price below $\$ 1$ .

# C Decomposition of Mroib’s Predictive Power

We verify that the long-term return predictability associated with negative and positive internalized retail order flow imbalances is not attributable to persistence in such internalization or contrarian trading. Following BJZZ, we decompose weekly internalized retail order flow imbalances and estimate the cross-sectional specification

$$
M r o i b v o l _ { j , w - 1 } = \lambda _ { w } ^ { 0 } + \lambda _ { w } ^ { 1 } M r o i b v o l _ { j , w - 2 } + \lambda _ { w } ^ { 2 } R _ { w - 2 } + \eta _ { j , w - 1 }
$$

to construct

$$
\begin{array} { r c l } { { \mathrm { P e r s i s t e n c e } _ { j , w - 1 } } } & { { = } } & { { \hat { \lambda } _ { w } ^ { 1 } M r o i b v o l _ { j , w - 2 } , } } \\ { { \mathrm { C o n t r a r i a n } _ { j , w - 1 } } } & { { = } } & { { \hat { \lambda } _ { w } ^ { 1 } R _ { j , w - 2 } , } } \\ { { \mathrm { O t h e r } _ { j , w - 1 } } } & { { = } } & { { \lambda _ { w } ^ { 0 } + \hat { \eta } _ { j , w - 1 } . } } \end{array}
$$

By construction, $M r o i b v o l _ { j , w - 1 } = \mathrm { P e r s i s t e n c e } _ { j , w - 1 } + \mathrm { C o n t r a r i a n } _ { j , w - 1 } + \mathrm { O t h e r } _ { j , w - 1 }$ . Substituting these components for $M r o i b v o l _ { j , w - 1 }$ in equation 2, we estimate

$$
\begin{array} { r c l } { { R _ { j , w + i } } } & { { = } } & { { d _ { w } ^ { 0 } + d _ { w } ^ { 1 p } \left( \mathrm { P e r s i s t e n c e } _ { j , w - 1 } \right) + d _ { w } ^ { 1 c } \left( \mathrm { C o n t r a r i a n } _ { j , w - 1 } \right) + d _ { w } ^ { 1 o } \left( \mathrm { O t h e r } _ { j , w - 1 } \right) } } \\ { { } } & { { + } } & { { d _ { w } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { ' } \mathrm { c o n t r o l s } _ { j , w - 1 } + u _ { j , w + i } , } } \end{array}
$$

with $i \in \{ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 1 2 , 2 4 , 3 6 , 3 9 , 4 2 , 4 5 , 4 8 , 5 1 , 5 4 , 5 7 , 6 0 \}$ . We fit Fama-MacBeth regressions with Newey-West-corrected standard errors using 6 lags.

Table C.1 reports estimated predictive powers of these three components of internalized retail order flow for future weekly returns. First note that our “Persistence” and “Other” coefficients for week $w$ ’s close-to-close returns of $0 . 3 2 \%$ and $0 . 0 8 \%$ , respectively, are quite close to their counterparts of 0.27% and 0.08% in BJZZ. Comparing the coefficients for the residual term, $\mathrm { ( ) t h e r } _ { w - 1 }$ , in Table C.1 to those of $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ in Table B.1 reveals that the significance of an $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ coefficient almost always corresponds to the significance of $\mathrm { ( ) t h e r } _ { w - 1 }$ ’s counterpart coefficient. For example, with week $w + i$ ’s closeto-close return as the dependent variable, when $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ has a negative coefficient for $k > 3 9$ , $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 } < 0$ also has a negative coefficient. A similar finding applies when $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 } > 0$ has a positive coefficient. Contrary to BJZZ’s interpretation that significant $\mathrm { ( ) t h e r } _ { w - 1 }$ coefficients indicate informed trading, the results conditioning on the sign of $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ indicate that the predictive power associated with this residual component reflects liquidity-driven price dynamics.

Table C . 1 : Decomposition of Mroibvol ’s Predictive Power for Future Weekly Returns ( $\%$ ) . This t able presents a decomposition to the overall predictive power of $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ for future returns into those of persistence , contrarian trading , and residual components . Daily returns are calculated based on the mid-points of best bid and ask prices at close as well as open prices , decomposing each day’s close-to-close returns into intraday (open-to-close) and overnight (close-to-open) before aggregating each return type into weekly observations . $M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 }$ is decomposed into Persistence , Contrarian, and Other components according to equation (5) . Each of the three return cross-sections for a given week $w + i$ , with $\in \{ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 1 2 , 2 4 , 3 6 , 3 9 , 4 1 , 4 5 , 5 8 , 5 1 , 5 4 , 5 7 , 6 0 \}$ , is decomposed based on the sign of week $w - 1$ ’s internalized order flow to form a total of nine samples . According to equation (9) , week $w + i$ returns in each sample are regressed on week $w - 1$ ’s Persistence , Contrarian, and Other components of the internalized order flow $( M r o i b v o l _ { w - 1 } )$ ) , whose loadings are reported in the t able , and control variables including last week ’ s return $\left( R _ { w - 1 } \right)$ , last month ’ s return $( R E T _ { - 1 }$ ) , the return over the preceding five months $( R E T _ { ( - 7 , - 2 ) } )$ , volatility (VOLAT) , and natural logs of turnover (ln (TO ) ) , market capitalization (ln ( Size) ) , and book-to-market ratio (ln (BM) ) . Estimates are based Fama-Macbeth regressions , featuring Newey-West corrected st andard errors with 6 lags . S ample includes NMS common shares from $\mathrm { J a n ~ 2 0 1 0 ~ - ~ D e c ~ 2 0 1 4 }$ , excluding observations with previous month-end ’s closing price below $\$ 1$ . Numbers in brackets reflect $\mathrm { t }$ -st atistics , and symbols \* \* \* , $^ { * * }$ , and \* identify st atistical significance at the $1 \%$ , $5 \%$ , and $1 0 \%$ type one errors , respectively.
