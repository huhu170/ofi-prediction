# Abstract

We study the interaction between imbalance of bid and ask orders and stock return, using two metrics for order imbalance and two whole years of data on every order placed for the 20 stocks most actively traded on the Australian market in those two years. We find bi-directional causality between imbalance and return, but not beyond a single day. We also see that the number of orders can explain current return, but the dollar value of orders can explain both current and future return. The speed of adjustment of price to order imbalance in Australia may be slow up to a day , but it is no slower than the NYSE. Price Ž . stabilisation behaviour is not present in Australia, suggesting that the order imbalancerreturn relationship is most likely informational. $©$ 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

# 1. Introduction

There is evidence that order flow and the existing limit order book interact with stock return in the short run. In particular, a temporal imbalance between buy and sell orders arriving at a market increases the likelihood that informed traders are attempting to pre-empt good or bad news, and prices and further orders react accordingly. Market structure may play an important role here. In one type of market, regulatory constraints force market makers to act to smooth out the impact of order imbalance, allowing a gentle rather than ‘‘jerky’’ transition from one equilibrium state to another. This price stabilisation process will hence slow the reaction of price to order imbalance. In a second type of market, these regulatory constraints are not in place, so we might expect the price reaction to occur earlier and subsequent reverberations to be less significant.

An excellent example of the first type is the New York Stock Exchange Ž . NYSE , which has a limit order book that is private apart from the quotes posted by specialists. They are charged with the task of ‘‘leaning against the wind’’ Ž . Madhavan and Smidt, 1991, p. 118 to stabilise prices in the event of an order imbalance. By contrast, the Australian Stock Exchange ASX is an electronicŽ . order-driven market, with a public limit order book affording a high level of market transparency. There is no formal NYSE-style price stabilisation mechanism at work, although trading is stopped when a company makes an announcement that the ASX deems to be price-sensitive, typically for about 10 minutes while brokers update existing orders or enter new ones. It is hence an excellent example of the second type of market.

So, a study of order imbalance in Australia will allow conclusions to be drawn which will contrast with results from the NYSE. This is the main focus of our paper.

# 2. Prior research on order imbalance and stock returns on the NYSE and ASX

# 2.1. NYSE

On the NYSE a monopolistic market maker – called a specialist – quotes prices and volumes at which he is willing to trade to any trader who asks for a quote. The specialist sets the bid–ask spread to compensate himself for inventory costs, processing and administration costs, and for any adverse selection costs he perceives he faces from the order flow. He also adds a monopolistic rent to the spread, since he does not face direct competition. While to outsiders this may seem a little inefficient why not introduce competition? strong arguments exist to Ž . maintain the system as it stands. Among them is the idea from Glosten 1989 that Ž . a monopolist can spread his profits over multiple trades, so he sometimes can keep a market open when a market with competing market makers would close. Another is that since the specialist is charged by the NYSE to stabilise prices, in return for the monopolistic position, volatility may be lower and price fluctuations may be offset. But by absorbing the imbalance into his inventory, he may spread out the price reaction that surely must follow the initial order imbalance.

Much of the work on the NYSE has assessed the impact of order imbalance indirectly; only a few have assessed its impact directly. The earliest work is Marsh and Rock 1986, p. 22 who find significant negative autocorrelation in hourly Ž . order imbalance out to five lags. This suggests that buys and sells arrive somewhat separately, and in ‘‘bunches’’. Hasbrouck and Ho 1987 , Hasbrouck 1991 and Ž . Ž . Walsh 1997 partly confirm this by finding that buys tend to follow buys and sells Ž . to follow sells. It is still an open question whether this pattern incorporates an informational effect or is driven wholly by the underlying order arrival process itself. We address the question by seeing if prices react significantly more quickly in a market without these stabilisers: that is, in Australia.

Marsh and Rock 1986 examine the relationship between order imbalance Ž . Ž Ž measured as standardised cumulative net trading volume – asksybids.rŽasks $^ +$ bids and return measured as the percentage change in the bid–ask midpoint . .. Ž . The analysis is performed using every tick whenever the bid or ask quote Ž changed and with hourly sampling. They presume that causality flows from . volume to price change, and use price change as the dependent variable in the regression. Their data are three random samples of 50 companies, one from each of the NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ markets, for the months of March and April 1985. The data used are time-stamped best bid and ask, and the trading volume and prices. Trades inside the spread are ignored. Marsh and Rock 1986 show that Ž . there is a significant relationship between order imbalance and return. Order imbalance exhibits a strong positive relationship with contemporaneous return, using both hourly sampling and tick-by-tick data. They find a strong size effect; in both sets of regressions, the impact of a given order imbalance e.g., 10,000 shares Ž or 1000 sell orders is less for larger firms. At the same time, the explanatory . power of the relationship improves with firm size, from an average $R ^ { 2 }$ value of $9 \%$ for the smallest quintile up to $2 5 \%$ for the largest quintile.

Blume et al. 1989 examine the order imbalance around October 19 and 20, Ž . 1987. They use 15-minute returns and an estimate of contemporaneous aggregate order imbalance based on the sum of the order imbalances of all stocks appearing at the bid and ask prices. It is an estimate because it ignores trades inside the Ž spread. They find a strong relationship between imbalance and return, but the . relationship is much stronger for firms in the S & P500 than for other firms. They suggest these results are ‘‘consistent with, but do not prove’’ p. 843 the Ž . hypothesis that the S&P500 firms experienced a much greater decline in price Ž . and subsequent rebound on these two days because of the excess selling pressure. Madhavan and Smidt 1993 find that specialists revise their inventory Ž . levels slowly, with less than half the revision taking place in a week, even after correcting for changes in the desired inventory level. Further, they find that daily price change is strongly related to the information contained in the non-block Ž . order imbalance over the day; that is, the unexpected component of the order imbalance. Block order imbalance contains little up-to-date information, suggest- Ž ing that any information has already leaked in the ‘‘upstairs’’ market. Huang and . Stoll 1994 use one-day lagged imbalance in volume quoted by the specialist to Ž . detect any impact it might have on daily return again using bid–ask midpoint . Ž .

Among other results, they find a strong relationship between this quoted order imbalance and the return: the more the number of net shares being sold, the greater the price decrease.

Lee 1992 examines the imbalance of trade direction the net number of sell Ž . Ž orders, not the net number of shares sold and finds that the order imbalance . before an earnings announcement is indistinguishable from any other time. After the announcement, there is no difference between the number of large buys and sells, but there is a significantly greater number of buys than sells for small orders. This is independent of whether the announcement contains good or bad news, or what the firm size is, or even how much total volume is traded. Rather than suggest that returns are driven by order imbalance, Lee’s 1992 results suggest the Ž . opposite.

We conclude that order imbalance however measured appears to have a Ž . significant effect on returns, both contemporaneously and lagged, and is autocorrelated, even at fine sampling intervals. To say that order imbalance causes some part of the returns is too strong, based on current evidence. We investigate this here, along with bi-directional causality. Also, the rate of correction of order imbalance has never been studied; it is a feature of this paper.

# 2.2. ASX

We know of two Australian studies of order imbalance. Yuen 1993 performs Ž . a study similar to Lee 1992 by examining the differences in trading volume of Ž . large and small orders around earnings and dividends announcements. In contrast to Lee 1992 , she finds a significantly lower volume of small buys both before Ž . and after the announcements compared to other periods, suggesting that the net volume of buy orders has no predictive power; it is not informational.

Kua 1993 uses a large ASX database to investigate the probability of a trade Ž . occurring at the ask price, conditioned on limit order imbalance immediately prior to the placement of the market order that triggered the trade. She finds that imbalance in live limit orders has no predictive power when measured using dollar volume, but curiously, that the probability of a trade at the ask decreases with a greater net number of buy orders. If correct, this could mean continuations are more common than reversals, which is contrary to much previous evidence, for example, Niederhoffer and Osborne 1966 . On the other hand, it does suggest that Ž . buys tend to follow buys and sells to follow sells, which has been documented elsewhere see above .Ž .

# 3. Research questions

We have seen that order imbalance and returns appear to be related. If the market uses either on-going price stabilisation or circuit breakers and trading halts, it can cope with an order imbalance crisis like October 1987 . However, the Ž . market’s reaction to non-crisis levels is unclear. Is the price reaction to order imbalance informational, or is it simply a smaller scale of the crisis reaction? Further, the exact causal nature of this relationship, if there is one, is unknown; for instance, does order imbalance lead price change, or vice versa?

In summary, we examine the following questions.   
1. Does order imbalance correlate with return?   
2. Which causes which?   
3. Is the effect informational or simply a result of price-smoothing?

On this third question, rather than examine the impact of using a trading halt, we examine the absence of trading halts. By comparing results in Australia, where no price-smoothing intervention is required, to the NYSE, where price smoothing supposedly is at work all the time, we may be able to gauge whether there is a difference. If we do see a difference, we might conclude that the impact is due to price smoothing on the NYSE. The direction of this difference is unclear, because while it would slow down the price impact of an order imbalance in transaction time i.e., it might take more orders for the impact to be incorporated , in calendar Ž . time the result may in fact be faster, because of the considerably greater volume on the NYSE. If we see no difference, we can either conclude that a the price Ž . smoothing impact exactly outweighs the increased volume impact which seems Ž unlikely , or b price smoothing is not driving this reaction at all: the price . Ž . changerorder imbalance relationship is an informational one.

# 4. Methodology

# 4.1. Trading on the ASX

The Australian market differs in important ways from the NYSE. The NYSE may be characterised as an order-driven market that opens with a call and requires its dealers specialists , who maintain private limit order books, to provide Ž . liquidity throughout the day. The ASX is also an order-driven market. But in contrast with the NYSE, the ASX order book is highly transparent, trading is wholly electronic and there are no appointed dealers or specialists, although some brokers act as pseudo-specialists by regularly providing trade facilitation services. A form of double auction applies until the ASX opens, when the market is immediately cleared. Thereafter, a trade occurs only when an incoming market order ‘‘hits’’ the best highest priority opposing limit order. Ž .

The ASX’s trading system, SEATS, functions through a series of interconnected terminals located principally in brokers’ offices. They and members of the public can observe in real time almost the entire limit order book for each listed security. The SEATS screen displays, for a given share, each unfilled limit order’s broker identification number, quantity and price, although for orders above a minimum size the quantity may be hidden.

Two major rules determine an order’s execution priority: price and time. 1 An imbalance of buy orders implies a longer expected wait in the buy side queue and a larger risk that a buyer’s limit order will not execute. 2 New buyers have to pay a premium for liquidity because in order to gain priority they must over-bid the existing best price. The same priority rules apply when the price or volume of an order is amended. When the volume is raised, the original portion volume of the Ž . amended order retains its priority and the additional volume is placed at the end of the queue at that price. When the volume is lowered, the order retains its priority. When the price of an order is amended it is placed at the end of the queue at the new price.

Regular trading hours are $1 0 \ \mathrm { a . m }$ . to $4 \ \mathrm { p . m }$ . The exact market opening time is random and within $\pm 1 5$ seconds of $1 0 \ \mathrm { a . m }$ . Opening is staggered over the first few minutes, with trading commencing by alphabetical groups. From 7.30 a.m. until market opening and for an hour after closing, SEATS is placed into ‘‘pre-opening mode’’, when new bids and asks may be entered and existing orders amended or deleted. $^ 3 \ \mathrm { F r o m } \ 5 \ \mathrm { p . m }$ . to $7 \ \mathrm { p . m }$ . the market is in ‘‘adjustment mode’’, when existing orders may be cancelled or amended away from the market but they can not be improved nor can new orders be entered. Overnight, the bid and ask queues are maintained, except that certain orders are purged from the market. Ž . 4 These include a stale orders, b orders that were ‘‘good for the day only’’ or Ž . otherwise have reached their expiry date, and c orders for shares that are to Ž . change their basis of quotation 5 overnight. At all other times SEATS is either in inquiry mode when users can retrieve existing information but no new bids or Ž asks may be entered or amendments made or in suspend mode no entries or . Ž inquiries can be made ..

# 4.2. Data and method

The database includes a complete record of every new order placed, amendments to and cancellations of orders, and the trades that occurred on SEATS from January 1994 to December 1995. Our sample consists of the 20 stocks that were continuously and most actively traded on the ASX over the two year period. They traded on average from about 120 NCM to more than 500 times a day BHP , Ž . Ž . together accounting for $3 8 \%$ of all on-market trades by number and $56 \%$ by value.

We construct two imbalance metrics, one based on the number of orders and the other on their size \$value . Imbalance is then defined as the total numberŽ . Ž . value of ask orders divided by the sum of bids and asks. By construction, the imbalance metric is bounded by $+ 1$ when there are no bids and zero when there Ž . Ž are no asks ; it is 0.5 if bids equal asks. The metric based on dollar value measures . the information content of the size of the orders arriving as well as the frequency of their arrival. If there is extra information in size, this metric should pick it up. On the other hand, the number metric does not contain this information, and hence has the effect of weighting smaller orders more heavily than they might otherwise be. Therefore, by comparing the results from both metrics we can obtain interesting conclusions regarding the differential impacts of large and small orders. While interesting, this exploration is left to future work.

Stock return is defined as the difference between the natural logarithms of two successive prices. Log returns are used because they mitigate bias induced by the bidrask spread and price discreteness Mucklow, 1991 . That bias can be negligi- Ž . ble for the daily returns of higher priced stocks, but for intraday returns it is greater. Price is measured by the average of the best bid and best ask price, to reduce measurement problems associated with bidrask bounce and non-trading.

We adopt a bivariate vector auto-regression VAR , based on a detailed Ž . specification search to ensure that the best model and metrics are used. Formally, the model is

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { R _ { t } = \displaystyle \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { k = n } \alpha _ { k } R _ { t - k } + \cdot \cdot \cdot + \sum _ { k = 0 } ^ { k = n } \beta _ { k } \mathrm { O I } _ { t - k } + u _ { t } , } \\ & { \mathrm { O I } _ { t } = \displaystyle \sum _ { k = 0 } ^ { k = n } \delta _ { k } R _ { t - k } + \cdot \cdot \cdot + \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { k = n } \gamma _ { k } \mathrm { O I } _ { t - k } + v _ { t } , } \end{array}
$$

where $\alpha , \beta , \delta$ and $\gamma$ are the parameters, $u$ and $v$ are the error terms and $t$ is the time period. Eqs. 1 and 2 as stated relate return, Ž . Ž . $R$ Ž . order imbalance, OI to lagged returns order imbalance and contemporaneous and lagged order imbal- Ž . ance returns . The number of lags, denoted byŽ . $n$ , varies according to the particular version of the model that is fitted. Also, sometimes the model is fitted without the contemporaneous value of the other variable appearing on the R.H.S. Regressions are fitted separately for each firm. A variety of diagnostics were used to increase our confidence in the correctness of the model and the inferences we draw from it.

# 5. Results

To examine the causality between order imbalance and returns, three data sets are developed for each stock separately. The first set consists of daily data, from close on one day to close on the next; the second divides the first into two periods, from close to open and open to close; the third set further divides the trading day into the six trading hours, to yield seven periods – close to open, plus the six trading hours from about $1 0 \ \mathrm { { a . m } }$ . to $4 \ \mathrm { p . m }$ . The order flow measures are as previously defined and the return series are based on the bid–ask midpoint at the end of each period. Table 1 contains means of the relevant variables for each stock. Return is on average positive for 11 of the 20 stocks. Its standard Ž deviation, not reported in the table, does not decline directly with the root of the number of sub-periods in the day, consistent with some autocorrelation in returns and a higher variance in overnight returns. For 16 stocks the imbalance by . number was less than by value.

20 ASX-listed stocks actively traded from January 1994 to December 1995. Imbalance is the ratio of Asks to Bids $^ +$ Asks. ‘‘Day’’ refers to a single daily period, close-to-close; ‘‘Dayrnight’’’ divides each day into two periods, close-to-open and open-to-close; and ‘‘Hourly’’ divides each day into seven periods, close-to-open and the six trading hours.

7 Data analysis proceeded as follows. Each endogenous variable return and Ž order imbalance is regressed on lagged values of itself and on the contemporane- . ous and lagged values of the other endogenous variable. Enders 1995,Ž $\textsf { p } 3 1 3 ,$ b notes that if a VAR specification is symmetric with identical lag lengths which is Ž almost true of the above specification it is estimated via OLS. If not, a maximum . likelihood approach is better. Here, we use OLS on the separate equations, even though the equations are not exactly symmetric. To examine the impact of the contemporaneous variables, the regressions are also run without them, as a sort of specification test. The equations are then truly symmetric and OLS is consistent and efficient.

An augmented Dickey–Fuller test Harvey, 1990, pp. 81–82 was initially used Ž . to test for unit roots in the two variables. All variables were stationary at conventional levels of significance. To select lag length, a general-to-specific approach was used, and three tests of lag length were employed; autocorrelation of residuals, a likelihood ratio test of rejection of a lag, and the Schwarz criterion test Ž . Judge et al., 1985, pp. 245–246 . All were consistent in suggesting that the relationship whatever it is appears to last no longer than a day. Ž .

Among other diagnostics, a Chow test Greene, 1991, p. 218 and a one-step Ž . ahead forecast error test were conducted for parameter constancy with a test sub-set of six of the 20 stocks. The parameters appeared to remain constant throughout the data set, suggesting that we can rely on both the significance and the level of the parameter estimates. Also, tests for non-linearity in the model Žspecifically, a RESET test and an $F$ -test of squared residuals regressed on squares and cross-products of regressors were conducted for the same six stocks but could . not reject linearity or correct functional form of the model. Residuals were found to fail normality and heteroscedasticity tests commonly, and tests for autocorrelation less commonly. These are a feature of most high frequency data in finance. We can partly correct the problems by using White’s heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors, which allow inference without concern for heteroscedasticity. In another set of tests, we removed intraday mean effects from returns and order imbalance and found the results were largely unaffected. Given all of these diagnostics, we can be reasonably assured of the causality tests that we run.

We conducted a Granger causality test, where we simply examine, in each endogenous variable’s regression, the significance of the set of coefficients of the ‘‘other’’ endogenous variable, including its contemporaneous value. 8 The conclusions would be:

Ø If neither set of coefficients is significant, no causality.   
Ø If only one is significant, uni-directional causality.   
Ø If both are significant, bi-directional causality.

Causality test results are summarised in Table 2. The hypothesised direction of causality is indicated by the arrow in the top row of the main body of the table, for instance from return to imbalance in the value of new orders. The second row indicates the data set to which the cell entries relate: close-to-close ‘‘Day’’ ; Ž . close-to-open plus open-to-close ‘‘DayŽ . rnight’’ ; and close-to-open plus the six trading hours ‘‘Hourly’’ . The value in each cell is the tail probability from a Ž . likelihood ratio test for significance of the set of parameter estimates. For instance, a value of 0.05 or less suggests that we can reject the null hypothesis of no causality with $9 5 \%$ confidence.

Several interesting conclusions follow from these results. Granger causality from order imbalance value to return is bi-directional when the contemporaneous Ž . values are included and imbalance relates to the value of orders entered each hour. This result is significant at the $1 \%$ level for 19 of the 20 stocks. The results are less persuasive when imbalance is measured by number of orders each hour: we reject the null in favour of bi-directional causality in only nine stocks at the $5 \%$ level and five at $1 \%$ . With both imbalance measures, bi-directional causality is significant for progressively fewer stocks as we increase the length of the measurement period. On the other hand, there is extremely strong evidence of return ‘‘causing’’ imbalance in the number of orders each hour, and it carries over into the daily order flow as well.

We also estimated the relationships when the contemporaneous terms are omitted. 9 The significance of the causality declines as we reduce sampling frequency. However, other results change substantially. Causality from number imbalance to return is significant in only one case, but in the reverse direction it is strong, being rejected only once. If value imbalance is used, strong bi-directional causality is found. Note that contemporaneous returns and order imbalance appear to be related in an important way. Imbalance in the number of orders can explain current but not future return, whereas imbalance in their dollar value can explain both. From our discussion of the different metrics, this conclusion suggests that smaller trades and hence perhaps smaller traders do not react immediately to the Ž . ‘‘news’’ in returns, but tend to follow.

20 ASX-listed stocks actively traded from January 1994 to December 1995. Contemporaneous values are included.

Imbalance is the ratio of Asks to $\mathrm { B i d s } + \mathrm { A s k s }$ . ‘‘Day’’ refers to a single daily period, close-to-close; ‘‘Dayrnight’’ divides each day into two periods, close-to-open and open-to-close; and ‘‘Hourly’’ divides each day into seven periods, close-to-open and the six trading hours. Daily and Dayrnight tests use two lags, hourly tests use three lags. The symbol $\ddot { \bf \Phi } \ddot { \bf A }  \mathrm { B } ^ { \prime } \dot { \bf \Phi }$ indicates that B was the dependent variable and the explanatory variables were lagged values of B and lagged and contemporaneous values of A. The $p$ -value, which is shown correct to $2 \mathrm { d } \mathsf { p }$ , indicates the probability that the observed causal effect, the direction being indicated by the symbol $^ { 6 6 } \to ^ { 5 5 }$ , was a chance event. That is, if $p < 0 . 0 1$ , we are $9 9 \%$ Ž  confident that the causality was not random indicated by a ..

indicating perhaps that they are more informed than smaller trades. This would support previous work for example, Walsh, 1996 . We cannot, however, refute Ž . the stealth trading hypothesis of Barclay and Warner 1993 here, without examin- Ž . ing the linearity of the relationship. Again, we leave this to future work.

In summary, we can see that the strong bi-directional causality at the hourly level between returns and number imbalance is probably due to the contemporaneous relationship. When the contemporaneous terms are omitted, the causality remains bi-directional between returns and imbalance by value but becomes uni-directional from returns to number imbalance. The two order flow measures – imbalance by number and value – behave quite differently, and different tests yield the same type of difference between them. It seems that imbalance in the number of orders has substantially less impact on return than does their dollar value, whereas return appears to drive both number and value of orders.

While the causality tests in Table 2 indicate how confidently the null can be rejected, we also report the explanatory power of three specifications: where the ‘‘other’’ variable’s lagged and contemporaneous values are included on the R.H.S.; where only its lagged values are included; and where it is totally excluded, so that the R.H.S. variables are exclusively lagged values of the dependent variable itself. Tables 3 and 4 relate to return and order imbalance by value and number, respectively.

Table 3 indicates negligible autocorrelation in hourly value imbalance and detectable but nevertheless weak autocorrelation in daily imbalance as well Žmaximum $R ^ { 2 }$ is 0.07; see columns headed ‘‘Excl. R’’ . Including the lagged . values of the ‘‘other’’ variable adds little explanatory power, most of which is associated with its contemporaneous value. Overall explanatory power is comparable, averaging $12 - 1 5 \%$ , for the return and order imbalance regressions and regardless of the data set Day, Day Ž . rNight and Hourly . Comparing Tables 3 and 4 again shows the contemporaneous relationship of return to imbalance is weaker for number than value. 10 In contrast with the negligible autocorrelation in hourly value imbalance, imbalance in the number of orders is strongly autocorrelated Žrefer column 10 of Table 4; average $R ^ { 2 }$ is 0.26 , and more strongly again for . daily imbalance column 4; average is 0.48 , where the overall explanatory power Ž . of the imbalance regression is at least $80 \%$ for three companies BOR, CBA, and Ž PDP and averages. $56 \%$ over the 20 column 2 . In this case i.e., where number  Ž . Ž imbalance is being predicted , although Table 2 shows return ‘‘causes’’ imbalance, . including the contemporaneous return adds little to the regression’s explanatory power with daily data, and about $5 \%$ on average with hourly and day Ž . rnight data.

Finally, we present graphical representations of the response of a return and Ž . Ž . Ž . Ž . Ž . b OI value to a single innovation or ‘‘impulse’’ in 1 return or 2 imbalance in the value of the order flow. We confine our graphs to those derived from the hourly data set. The graphs are drawn using the coefficients from the regressions of return on imbalance that are represented in columns 8 and 17 of Table 3; i.e., the contemporaneous values of the ‘‘other’’ variable are included among the regressors. To generate the graphs, Fig. 1 for instance assumes an initial return innovation exogenous shock sufficient to induce a return ofŽ . $1 \%$ in the first hour; we assume the initial shock is to price and not to imbalance in the value of orders per se, although order imbalance is naturally affected via the price–order imbalance interaction we are modelling. The initial return innovation is the value shown in period 0; the cumulative return in period 1 results from the initial innovation and the subsequent interaction between price and order flow over the first hour; and the cumulative effect on return is then traced for the next 19 periods. Similarly, Fig. 2 assumes an initial order flow innovation that leads to a $+ 0 . 1 6 7$ order imbalance over the first hour approximately one standard deviation ; an Ž . innovation of 0.167 would be consistent, for example, with a shift in order flow from equal buys and sells, to sells outnumbering buys 2 to 1. The effect of return on the interaction between order flow and return is then traced for each of the next 19 periods. Figs. 3 and 4, which trace the response of OI value to an innovation in return and OI value, respectively, are generated in much the same way. The main difference is that the OI response is not cumulated over time. 11

Figs. 1 and 4 give the impulse response functions for return, the cumulative Ž IRF for impulses in themselves. While this does not examine the sensitivity and . lag structure of the causal relationships we principally concentrate on, the results are still quite interesting. In Fig. 1, note that the impulse in period $( - 1 , 0 )$ is such that the cumulative IRF is exactly $1 \%$ at the end of the period 0, 1 , for allŽ .

companies. The initial impulse ranges between $8 5 \%$ and $90 \%$ of the total price change that was seen. The return innovation appears to induce a further but smaller price increase in the hour following the initial impulse. In 19 of the 20 companies studied, this is then followed by a return reversal of approximately $1 0 \%$ of the initial impulse, but in 16 of the 20 companies, the cumulative response remains above the initial impulse. Fourteen of the 20 remain above $1 \%$ , and BHP has the largest cumulative gain of $1 . 1 4 \%$ . Interestingly, this suggests that innovations in returns take more than an hour to become fully incorporated up to three Ž or four hours in most cases . Further, it suggests that there is an initial over-reac- . tion by the market, indicated by the return reversal. However, of more interest is the result that for most companies the return innovation contains ‘‘news’’ – a positive return innovation induces a non-zero positive response. This supports previous results like Walsh 1997 . In Fig. 4, the size of the innovation required to Ž . induce a 0.167 impulse response at the end of period 0, 1 varies betweenŽ . $8 5 \%$ and $9 2 \%$ of 0.167. Note that this graph is not a cumulative impulse function. The results are uniform across companies in the sample; within two or three hours of the innovation, the effects completely die away, and the initial innovation is followed by almost no further reaction.

Figs. 2 and 3 examine the impact of innovations of one variable on the other variable. Fig. 2 gives the cumulative impulse response of return to an OI innovation that leads to a 0.167 response in OI at the end of period 0, 1 . A Ž . positive impulse in OI that is, an increase in the proportion of sell orders leads Ž . for every company to a decrease in return, taking up to 3 hours to become fully incorporated. The total cumulative impact of this ‘‘one standard deviation’’ order imbalance impulse on return is in total between $- 0 . 1 4$ and $- 0 . 3 7 \%$ . Fig. 3 shows the response of OI to an innovation that leads to a $1 \%$ initial return. Again, this is not a cumulative response. After the initial response in period 0,1 , the OI Ž . reverses strongly. A positive innovation in return induces a strong buy order imbalance, followed by a strong correcting sell order imbalance, in all cases larger than the initial response. After this reversal, the OI settles down within about $^ { 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ .

The same four graphs were generated for the interaction between return and OI number. The results are very similar, although the lag structure of OI number is different to that of OI value, producing less stable impulse response functions. 12

# 6. Conclusions

Causality tests were conducted on the 20 most actively traded stocks over the two years 1994–95. Three data sets, comprising midpoint returns and imbalance in the number and value of buy and sell orders, were formed for each stock: close-to-close; close-to-open and open-to-close; and close-to-open plus the six trading hours. We found that, for an individual stock, if the contemporaneous observation of order flow imbalance return is included in the return order flowŽ . Ž imbalance regression, causality is bi-directional. When it is excluded, the causal- . ity results change substantially: order value affects returns but the number of orders does not. Conversely, returns affect imbalance in the number and value of new orders placed.

Impulse response functions were plotted using estimates from hourly return and OI value data. We saw that an exogenous price rise typically triggers an additional but smaller rise in the first hour, followed by a partial reversal in the second hour of about a tenth of the initial innovation. Similarly, it induces a surge in the value of buys relative to sells, which is followed in the second hour by an imbalance in favour of sells. An exogenous increase in the value of sells leads to more sell orders and lower prices. In all cases the adjustment is complete within about three hours. A fair conclusion is that, on the ASX, a buy order imbalance is weakly associated with higher future prices and a sell order imbalance with lower prices. Finally, because adjustment to order imbalance appears to be within two or three hours on the ASX, imbalance in the value of new orders placed is probably driven more by information than by price stabilisation per se.

At least two clear directions of further research present themselves. First, examining cross-listed securities between exchanges would allow direct control over firm-specific effects, leaving exchange-related effects to appear in the results.13 Second, exploring the number and size of orders as different metrics will almost certainly provide fruitful conclusions on the information content of different ‘‘areas’’ of the order flow. As we noted earlier, there is a strong informational difference between the metrics, and this will reflect in trading size and frequency.
