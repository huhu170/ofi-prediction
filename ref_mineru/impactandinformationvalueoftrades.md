# Abstract

We examine information, market impact and trade sizes using a dataset of institutional trades aggregated into metaorders, where approximately $1 / 4$ is a subset labeled as having been created for cash flow purposes. We find that during the execution the functional form and scale of market impact are similar for cash flows and other metaorders. Differences arise in the price reversion following the end of a metaorder. For cash flows, the impact reverts almost completely on average in two to five days. For other metaorders we find that reversion erases about $1 / 3$ of peak impact: for each size, price reverts to the average execution price, leaving no immediate profits after accounting for trading costs. Observed mark-to-market profits on metaorders that aggregate multiple portfolio manager orders, new trades and Nasdaq-listed stocks suggest that these trades are more informed than the average. Viceversa, we find mark-to-market losses on cash flows, trades that follow momentum and additions to a prior position seeking to take advantage of an improved price. The complete price reversion for uninformed trades suggests that prices cannot be manipulated as assumed in no-quasi-arbitrage arguments for the linearity of permanent impact. There is no permanent impact, only information that causes trades.

# 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background

It is widely recognized that indirect trading costs cause a significant drag on fund performance, leading $80 \%$ of actively managed funds to underperform the market index (Forbes, 2012). Institutions are aware of this problem and, in spite of the potential timing costs associated with the loss of informational advantage, they choose to split their large trades into numerous slices and execute them incrementally over time to try to reduce market impact (Chan & Lakonishok, 1995; Keim & Madhavan, 1995). As the execution progresses there is a direct impact on price through the mechanical effects on the order book (Hopman, 2007; Bouchaud et al. 2004, 2009). But there may be also an indirect impact originated from the effect of the execution on expectations of market participants. It is generally agreed that although wider market information can come through many channels, market impact is the mechanism whereby information is conveyed to the market through trade execution (Grossman and Stiglitz 1980; Grosman 1989).

In this paper we aim to test some of the predictions of models that explore the roles of information and mechanical effects on market impact. We use a dataset of 129,944 metaorders from 112 portfolio managers or strategies to measure price reversion after the last fill. We find that the process of posttrade reversion continues for an amount of time approximately equal to the execution time. The expected return after reversion, or “permanent impact”, is such that institutional metaorders excluding cash flows break even after reversion. The impact of cash flow trades reverts much more strongly, quite often reverting completely. This evidence suggests that permanent impact measures the information of a trade.

Understanding the mechanisms that shape market impact is important for execution optimization (Alfonsi et al. 2010; Almgren and Chriss 1999, 2001; Almgren et al. 2005; Bertismas and Lo, 1998; Bouchaud et al. 2009; Obizhaeva and Wang 2013; Hasbrouck 2007; Criscuolo and Waelbroeck 2012, 2013) and for portfolio optimization to determine the optimal scale and turnover ratio for an actively managed fund (Berk and Green 2004; Schwartzkopf and Farmer 2010). The current body of literature comprises two schools of thought regarding the relationship between market impact and information.

One school of thought refers to market impact as the market's attempt at pricing the expected value of the information that led to the creation of an order. If the market were to know that a trade is not informed, for example because a trade was pre-announced, according to this view it should be possible to execute it without impact2. The alternative school of thought is that market impact is primarily a mechanical process: information is too difficult to measure so the market simply processes a stream of buy and sell orders which cause price changes through the mechanics of a double auction process. When a metaorder has finished the market accepts the new price and follows an unbiased random walk from that point forward. According to this view, the impact of informed trades should be about the same as uninformed trades, and there should be no benefit in pre-announcing trades.

In the next few paragraphs we will review some of the prior literature on the relationship between impact and information, then some of the work on mechanical impact models, before summarizing our empirical findings in this context.

Glosten and Milgrom (1985) describe the offer price as the expected future price conditioned only on the information that the next order arrival will be a buy, whereas the bid is the expected future price conditioned on the next order being a sell. In Hasbrouck's words, "orders do not impact prices, it is more accurate to say that orders forecast prices" (J. Hasbrouck, 2007). For trades larger than the size immediately available at the bid or ask, investors may have to pay more than the expected future price to compensate liquidity providers for incurring risk.

Gabaix et al. (2006) envision a fund manager receiving an information signal about a possible mispricing and determining the optimal trade size, aiming to maximize profit subject to a cap on trading cost as a percent of the fund's value to limit the loss when there is no mispricing. As in Torre (1997) they assume first order risk aversion of liquidity providers and find a square root impact function; they also assume that total impact is proportional to temporary impact . Using the Zipf law for bank sizes3 and the square root impact function, the authors show that trades cause price shocks with a tail exponent of 3 and have a size distribution with a tail exponent of $3 / 2$ . These exponents are consistent with empirical observations(Liu et al. 1999, Plerou et al. 1999). The size distribution has been validated empirically in Lillo et al. (2005) and Vaglica et al. (2008). At first glance the model of Gabaix et al. does not appear to be an equilibrium model: if investors are maximizing profits, they are also maximizing the losses of other market participants. Market participants with systematic losses would eventually be driven out of business or simply stop trading. But the profit is an average of two possible outcomes depending on whether the model is right or wrong. If the portfolio manager’s model is wrong there are no mispricings and the outcome is simply a loss equal in magnitude to the trading costs. The probability that the model is right is unobservable, so portfolio managers use the loss tolerance parameter instead to limit trade sizes. If portfolio managers are overconfident in their model, they will set a high loss tolerance parameter and overtrade, potentially resulting in losses on average.. There is a value of the loss tolerance parameter such that the average profit is equal to zero. Since the trading profit for the optimal strategy is a constant multiple of the information, if profits are null on average they must be null for every trade size. In this sense, at equilibrium the model of Gabaix et al. (2006) is consistent with Hasbrouck's claim that trade sizes predict information.

General equilibrium models explicitly aim to determine the optimal policy of the investor given the expected response of liquidity providers, who in turn price the stock assuming that investors are making rational decisions. There are two cases to consider, depending on whether the investor's information is private or public. Kyle (1985) considers the case where an insider knows the closing price of the security in advance. The insider maximizes profits at the expense of noise traders by executing at a constant speed until price reaches the informed price at the end of the session; at that point everyone discovers the final price and there is no reversion. Fair pricing theory (Farmer et al. 2013) (FGLW) considers the opposite case, where a large number of investors receive the same information signal. Their orders are aggregated into a metaorder which is executed over time. Once filled, shares are allocated to the investors at the average price. FGLW show that these assumptions lead to a Nash equilibrium where metaorder sizes are such that their impact matches the information. This result is called "fair pricing" because the average price paid to execute a sequence of trades from the same metaorder is on average equal to the post-reversion price, so both the institution and liquidity providers break even4. The assumption in Gabaix et al. (2006) that total impact is proportional to temporary impact is derived as a property of the equilibrium.

The other school of thought assumes that agents, rather than being purely rational, simply adopt the current price as a reference point and randomly place buy or sell orders. Slices from institutional orders interact with the order book and cause impact according to the mechanics of a double auction market. In the absence of reliable information on fair prices, the market adopts the new price as reference in pricing new orders, and so part of the impact becomes permanent. In a slightly different version of this model impact is amplified by herding behavior (Froot et al. 1992, Cont and Bouchaud 2000, Lillo et al. 2008): traders respond to a common signal and cause mechanical impact regardless of information. The end result in terms of permanent impact depends on whether there are trades made in the opposite direction to “undo” the mechanical impact of the original trades. The most basic within the mechanical impact category are zero-intelligence models, which aim to explain price dynamics at the microstructure level assuming only random order flows and a double auction process (Farmer et al. 2005). Remarkably, zero-intelligence models correctly predict important statistical properties of the order book (Hopman, 2007). More recently, Bouchaud, Gefen, Potters and Wyart (Bouchaud et al. 2004) have showed that market data is more consistent with an $\epsilon$ -intelligence viewpoint where a very small fraction of the orders are informed. This viewpoint is corroborated and made more concrete in a model we will refer to here as the $\epsilon$ -intelligence model (Toth et al. 2012), where the order book is formed from a random statistical stream of limit orders and market orders. The market orders consume limit orders near the current market price. As the authors show, over time this results in a V-shape of the order book, i.e. the depth of the order book grows linearly with the distance from the midpoint price. It follows that the impact of immediate market orders grows as a square root of trade size. The authors use numerical simulations to study the impact of orders that are executed algorithmically over time. Toth et al. (2012) show that the market operates at a critical point between a sub-diffusive world dominated by market makers where price fluctuations are mean reverting and a super-diffusive mode where directional traders drive price trends.

The two schools of thought lead to slightly different predictions about the shape of the impact function and about the amount of reversion after a trade is completed. According to the $\epsilon$ -intelligence model, impact scales as a power $\delta$ of trade size ranging from $\delta { = } 0 . 5 5$ for very rapid executions $30 \%$ participation) to $\delta \mathrm { = } 2 / 3$ for slower ones $5 \%$ participation). In the slower case, peak impact will be $\delta + 1 = 5 / 3$ of the shortfall, after which price reverts by $2 5 \%$ . This implies that trades are profitable after reversion. In contrast, information-based theories derive the impact exponent $\delta$ from the tail exponent $\beta$ of the cumulative distribution of metaorders, which itself follows from the tail exponent $\zeta _ { r }$ of information shocks as $\frac { 2 \beta - 1 } { \beta - 1 } = \zeta _ { r } + 1$ (Gabaix et al. 2006, Farmer et al. 2013). For $\zeta _ { r } = 3$ (Plerou et al. 1999, Gabaix et al. 2006), this implies that $\beta = 1 . 5 , \ \delta$ should be equal to the tail exponent of the metaorder size distribution minus 1, i.e. $\begin{array} { r } { \delta = \beta - 1 = \frac { 1 } { 2 } } \end{array}$ . These results are consistent with the findings from order splitting models that show how the metaorder size distribution creates order flow autocorrelation with a tail exponent $\gamma = \beta - 1$ (Lillo et al. 2005); so the impact scaling exponent is predicted to be the same as the auto-correlation exponent. Various studies have reported different values of the auto-correlation exponents depending on the stock and listing market. Lillo et al. (2005) find $\gamma = 0 . 5 3$ for Shell; Toth et al. (2012) find an exponent close to 0.5 for a set of liquid stocks from the London Stock Exchange; Eisler et al. (2012) find $\gamma = 0 . 7$ ; Farmer et al. (2006) and Bouchaud et al. (2004) find the exponent to be in the ranges of 0.52-0.57 and 0.2-0.7, respectively. Order size distributions have been found to have power-law tails with exponents consistent with $\gamma = \beta - 1$ : 1.56 for a buy-side firm (Bershova and Rakhlin, 2013) or 1.7 for brokerages in the Spanish stock exchange (Vaglica et al. 2008). Taking $\beta = 1 . 5$ as an example, FGLW show that impact grows as a square root of trade size, reaches a peak of 1.5 times the shortfall, then reverts by $1 / 3$ back to the shortfall.

Empirical observations of the shape of the impact function have been discussed elsewhere (Almgren et al. 2005, Engle et al. 2008) and generally confirm a power law with exponent in the range [0.4, 0.7]. Kyle and Obizhaeva (2013) have argued that such empirical studies can be affected by a selection bias where the heterogeneity among assets can distort the observed exponent for market impact. They proposed a microstructure invariance hypothesis that the distribution of risk transfers, or "bets", is constant across assets when measured in units of business time. Using this hypothesis they control for the heterogeneity in assets with a market activity factor and confirm that market impact in a set of portfolio transactions scales as a power of trade size with an exponent of $0 . 5 7 \pm 0 . 0 4$ .

Our own estimates are consistent with a square root shape of the impact function, but we cannot reject slightly different exponents mentioned above. Our results on reversion show $1 / 3$ reversion from peak impact, but again we cannot reject the slightly lower prediction of $2 5 \%$ reversion in the $\epsilon$ -intelligence model. Our main conclusions are:

(1) We cannot reject the prediction of mechanical impact models that the shape and scale of market impact during the execution process is the same for cash flow trades as for other trades

(2) We cannot reject the fair pricing condition for all trades or for trades excluding cash flows (3) We reject fair pricing for cash flows. Instead, we find that cash flow trades have no permanent impact

These results suggest that both schools of thought on the nature of market impact are essentially right: market impact is primarily mechanical during the execution process in the sense that it does not differentiate informed from uninformed trades, but also, the observation that reversion for non cashflow trades is consistent with fair pricing while cash flows revert completely shows that impact reflects the average information content of trades.

We had to make some assumptions in preparing the data before deriving these results. We merged overlapping trades and near-overlapping trades from the same firm on the same side into a single metaorder and only considered for analysis those metaorders above $1 \%$ of the average daily volume in the security. Additional trades in the same security that are clearly separated from the initial one, but still within the window used to observe reversion, cause a bias in post-execution returns. To address this issue, we used an impact model to estimate the incremental impact of subsequent trading and adjusted prices by removing this impact from observed prices. The cash flow label is not available for all portfolio managers in our dataset; the subset of trades that are not labeled may include some cash flows.

Our methodology for merging trades has commonalities with other empirical studies of metaorders that combine multiple trades. Chan and Lakonishok (1995) introduced this concept in an empirical study by treating an entire sequence of trades from the same manager spanning over multiple days, albeit with some intervals, as their basic unit of analysis of market impact. Keim and Madhavan (1997), Torre (1997) and Almgren et al. (2005) are other examples of a number of studies that attempt to link sequences of trades that are part of the same transaction. Moro et al. (2009) take a slightly different approach by inferring hidden institutional orders from the analysis of rates of execution from different brokers. Bershova and Rakhlin (2013) looked at single-day trades from AllianceBernstein and a thirdparty dataset that stitched together multi-day orders where the net accumulation was at least $5 \%$ of median daily volume in each day. Our handling of the data differs to some extent from these studies since we may aggregate trades across managers within the same firm and consider maximum time gap of 60 minutes between trades that are aggregated across managers.

The response to trades with various information contents is of crucial importance to the market microstructure literature but, empirically, the role of information on permanent impact has been difficult to study due to lack of data. Llorente et al. (2002) have emphasized the differential impact of informed and liquidity trades but are only able to identify these trades separately by proxy (spread and market capitalization). Obizhaeva (2007) argues that sells in portfolio transitions are likely to be less informed than buys since incoming portfolio managers typically implement a target portfolio based on their preferences and liquidate the existing positions to fund the purchases. The author does not explicitly test the fair pricing conditions, but the results suggest complete reversion for sells and fair pricing for buys5. Coval and Stafford (2007) distinguish forced sales as those where mutual funds with large outflows are selling, as opposed to widespread selling that is not related to cash flow needs and therefore is more likely related to information. They find that forced sales (or buys) are followed by full reversion, whereas widespread sales (or buys) only revert in part. Alexander, Cici and Gibson (2007) also find that buys during outflows are profitable whereas buys during inflows are not. Mitchel, Pulvino and Stafford (2004) study merger pricing periods as examples of uninformed cash flows where risk arbitrageurs short the acquiring firm and buy the shares of the target, in a bet that the deal will close. The selling causes abnormal returns of $- 3 . 1 8 \%$ in the period followed by $2 . 5 3 \%$ reversion. Other authors present findings that suggest that trades unlikely to be informed are associated with complete reversion as, for example, Alexander et al. (2007), Andrade et al. (2008) and Da et al. (2007).

Our empirical analysis adds to this literature by testing the predictions of competing models on the role of information. We consider the mark-to-market P&L of metaorders at the reversion price by comparing the price paid for the position to the price after reversion is complete. Fair pricing is the condition that the P&L should be equal to zero on average for every trade size. As mentioned previously, our results suggest that the fair pricing condition holds, confirming the evidence recently provided by Bershova and Rakhlin (2013). But, for most orders, the point estimates of reversion are also consistent with pure mechanical effects along similar lines as the $\epsilon$ -intelligence model. The observation of a much stronger reversion in cash flows is the most difficult to reconcile with mechanical impact and gives more support to the theory that the information content of trades determines their permanent impact. If this is true, then it would follow that larger metaorders must be more informed on average than small ones.

We explore further the role of information by looking for significant factors that would cause deviations from fair pricing in a regression analysis. A positive P&L is characteristic of metaorders that are too small relative to the information, whereas a negative P&L represents overtrading. We find that metaorders that follow intraday momentum, trades in large cap stocks and additions to a prior position seeking to take advantage of an improved price are more likely to incur excessive implementation shortfalls relative to their short-term information. On the contrary, Nasdaq stocks and metaorders that aggregate orders from multiple managers tend to be profitable for the portfolio on a mark-to-market basis after reversion, as do new trades in a stock where the portfolio manager has not been active in the last 3 months.

In the next section we will explain the data preparation in more detail and present the summary statistics. In section 3 we provide formal tests of breakeven, efficiency and fair pricing. In section 4 we explore deviations from the fair pricing condition. In section 5 we compare the shape and scale of the impact function for cash flows vs other trades. We conclude in section 6 discussing the significance of our findings.

# 2. Data and Summary Statistics

Our proprietary dataset was built from Order Management System (OMS) data files made available to us by institutional clients with the main purpose of determining the alpha profiles for each portfolio manager i.e. the main drivers of trade urgency and the corresponding optimal trade scheduling [Criscuolo and Waelbroeck, 2012]. All files include a portfolio manager identifier, the order ID, the time of order creation, and in most cases, details on time, price and quantity of each partial fill. In addition, most portfolio managers’ orders were labeled by the portfolio management system that sends orders to the OMS with a cash flow tag, indicating if the order was created by the portfolio manager to invest inflows or fund outflows.

Typically, the OMS auto-corrects the initial order size to the actual executed size with the result that the information on unfilled shares is not reliable. The only discrepancy between the order information and the executed trade may be the start time if there is a significant delay between order creation and time of first fill. For the purpose of analysis of market impact, the trade originated from a single order by one portfolio manager may not be the relevant unit of observation: some portfolio managers send orders in multiple blocks, preferring to see the result of the first block before sending the next. In other instances, a firm's internal research model identifies an opportunity and triggers order creations by multiple portfolio managers. In these cases, each block is assigned a different order ID at creation time, but once orders reach the trading desk they are usually merged into a single trade to be executed as a unit; the fills are then allocated to portfolio managers at the average price. Even if the desk chooses to execute multiple blocks separately instead of merging them into a single unit there is no way for market participants to distinguish different blocks from the same portfolio manager or from different portfolio managers since orders are sent to the market anonymously. Hence, the impact of the multiple orders will be the same as for a merged metaorder. For these reasons, we chose to aggregate overlapping trades and near-overlapping trades from the same desk into an aggregated metaorder which better represents what market participants can observe throughout the overall execution time. More specifically, we merge orders in the same symbol and side if they were placed on the same day or consecutive open-market days by the same portfolio manager, or placed by another portfolio manager at the same firm within 60 minutes of each other counting only open-market time.

Orders labeled as cash flows can be merged with other cash flow orders but are not merged with orders that were not labeled as cash flows since these will be analyzed separately. For the remainder of the paper, aggregates of orders from the same desk will be our primary unit of analysis and will be referred to interchangeably as metaorders or trades.

For each metaorder, we compute the average realized price per share and the peak impact measured as the return from the mid-quote at the beginning of the first segment to the mid-quote at the end of the last segment. We also consider returns to the same-day market close and to the market close 1, 2, 5, and 10 days later, measured from the mid-quote at the beginning of the first segment. Reversion after trade completion is estimated as the symmetric return from the market close at each day to the midquote at the time of the last fill.

Stock returns after the completion of the metaorder may be significantly biased by the execution of additional metaorders from the same manager or other managers within the firm in the same security, which are clearly separated from the initial one. We address this bias by removing the net impact of the cumulative sum of all subsequent buy and sell metaorders from the desk, in the same security, executed within the reversion time window. The unbiased estimate of reversion until day $t$ is derived from the observed stock returns from last fill $( P _ { e n d } )$ to the market close at the $t ^ { \prime }$ th day after the end of the trade $( P _ { c l o s e , t } )$ , net of the estimated impacts of the additional buy and sell metaorders $\begin{array} { r } { \sum _ { t } Q _ { B } , \sum _ { t } Q _ { S } } \end{array}$ until that time. We consider up to 10 days after the trade ends. Using logarithmic returns multiplied by 10,000 to be expressed in basis points,

$$
R e v e r s i o n _ { t } = \ s i g n \times \left[ 1 0 , 0 0 0 \times \ln \left( P _ { e n d } / P _ { c l o s e , t } \right) + i m p a c t \left( \sum _ { t } Q _ { B } \right) - i m p a c t \left( \sum _ { t } Q _ { B } \right) \right]
$$

Where:

$$
t = e n d + 0 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 1 0 d a y s
$$

$s i g n = + 1$ for a buy metaorder and $s i g n = - 1$ for a sell metaorder

The square root impact model for the additional positions has been derived and tested in the previous literature [(Torre, 1997; Gabaix et al. 2003 and 2006; Moro et al. 2009; Engle et al. 2008) and includes as main arguments the annualized daily volatility of the stock in percent and the square root of size (Q) relative to average daily volume (ADV). The model is calibrated by setting the scale factor so that the average expected impact is equal to the mean realized shortfall in our sample:

$$
i m p a c t ( Q ) = 2 . 8 \times v o l a t i l i t y \times \sqrt { Q / A D V }
$$

We believe this method to be a superior alternative to restricting the analysis to metaorders without subsequent add-ons since additional positions on the same stock are very common and the sample size would be reduced considerably. For example, in our data $80 \%$ of the metaorders have subsequent addons. Additional positions on the same stock are also more likely to be on the same side and more frequent after price improvement, so restricting the dataset would create selection bias.

The constructed sample comprises 129,944 metaorders larger than $1 \%$ of daily volume originated by a total of 112 portfolio managers across several large institutional asset managers between July 2009 and March 2012. Approximately $2 5 \%$ of the metaorders in the sample are labeled as cash flows in the order management system. In our analysis, we consider the subset with duration of at least 5 minutes and a participation rate below $50 \%$ in order to drop metaorders that are likely to be dominated by a block execution. We also drop metaorders with a starting price below $\$ 1$ or annualized volatility above $200 \%$ .

The statistical properties of metaorders are described in Appendix D. The distribution of trade durations falls off with a tail exponent $\zeta _ { T } = 1 . 8$ . The metaorder size distribution excluding cash flows has a tail exponent $\beta = 1 . 5$ ; for cash flows the size distribution best fits a log normal.

Table 1 includes descriptive statistics of the remaining 27,591 cash flows and 87,658 other metaorders. Volatility is the annualized percentage deviation from the average close-to-close price returns over the prior 90 days. Spread is the average of the nonzero differences between bid and offer, in basis points, measured at the start time and end time of the metaorder. If there is a market cross at both times, we take the spread from the closest metaorder. The results show that cash flows are smaller with a median size of $2 . 2 \%$ of average daily volume as compared to $5 . 1 \%$ for other trades; they are also executed more patiently with an average participation rate of $6 \%$ versus $1 3 \%$ for other metaorders.

Table 1. Descriptive statistics of metaorders. The median metaorder size is $2 . 2 \%$ of average daily volume for cash flow trades and $5 . 1 \%$ for other trades. Cash flows also tend to be executed more slowly with an average participation rate of $6 \%$ versus $1 3 \%$ for other trades.

# 3. Breakeven, Efficiency and Fair Pricing

# 3.1 Breakeven and Efficiency

We analyze the breakeven condition for institutional investors (and liquidity providers) in Tables 2a and 2b. In Table 2a we show the averages for several relevant returns. Shortfall is the difference between the average execution price and the mid-quote at arrival, expressed in basis points, multiplied by 1 for buys or -1 for sells. Peak impact is measured from mid-quote at arrival to mid-quote at the time of the last fill, also signed by the metaorder side. Close is the signed return from metaorder arrival to the market close of the day the trade was completed. Close $^ { + 1 }$ , 2, 5 and 10 days are the signed returns from arrival until the market close on the next day and the next 2, 5 and 10 days after completion, respectively. The difference between each return and the shortfall represents the mark-to-market P&L for investment managers at the respective market close. The results show that the P&L is always statistically significant and negative for cash flows, whereas it becomes insignificant after 2 days for other metaorders.

In Table 2b the returns are beta-adjusted to remove the systematic component from market drift. We define beta-adjusted shortfall as the shortfall minus one half of the stock's beta times the change in the S&P500 index from the start to the end of the trade, signed by the metaorder side. The factor of one half reflects the assumption that the execution takes place uniformly from the beginning to the end of the trade and the market drift is linear over that period. For the beta-adjusted peak impact we subtract the full S&P500 return from start to end of trading. Similarly, the beta-adjusted returns to each market close subtract the full S&P500 return throughout the respective time window.

Table 2a, b: Average returns from arrival and average $\pmb { \alpha }$ (bps). Shortfall, peak impact and returns to the market close after the trade is completed are shown both in terms of absolute returns (top) and in terms of beta-adjusted returns (bottom). Bootstrapped standard errors are in parenthesis. \* Denotes significance at the 5 percent level or better. The results show that cash flows are profitable for liquidity providers; for the other metaorders (and the overall set) the results are consistent with breakeven on average.

The average beta-adjusted shortfall for cash flows is 24 basis points and the peak impact at the end of these trades is 27.3 bps. After the trade is finished, price reverts completely retracing the impact by ${ \mathsf { T } } { + } 5$ . The other metaorders incur an adjusted shortfall of 34.9 bps and a peak impact of 48.2 bps. Reversion brings the adjusted return from arrival to 34.5 bps at $\top + 2$ , within 0.4bps of the shortfall. Thus, with or without beta adjustment, the post-reversion prices for all metaorders excluding cash flow trades at the market close on $\top + 2$ , ${ \mathsf { T } } { + } 5$ and $\mathtt { T } + 1 0$ are not statistically different from the average execution price - i.e., these metaorders break even on average.

Breakeven averaged over all metaorder sizes follows from the perfect competition between liquidity providers. If metaorders made money on average, liquidity providers would be driven out of business. If they lost money to liquidity providers, the latter would compete more aggressively and in so doing drive impact costs lower. Interestingly, our findings suggest that cash flow trades are profitable for the liquidity provider. At first glance this would seem to violate market efficiency. However, when liquidity providers compete to interact with a metaorder on the market, they have no way to know whether a trade originates from a cash flow or an investment decision. Glosten and Milgrom (1985) show that the liquidity providers gain against the least informed traders in order to make zero expected profits and recoup losses they incur when trading against the most informed traders. If we blend results from cash flow trades and other trades, the value-weighted average P&L of liquidity providers at $\top + 2$ is indistinguishable from zero at -0.19bps.

Tables 2a and 2b show that the beta adjustment of stock returns has a significant impact on cash flows and other metaorders, although it is more visible for cash flows. One of the main differences is that, although returns to close at $+ 5$ days and $+ 1 0$ days are negative for cash flows, they are not statistically significant from 0 when returns are not beta-adjusted. Returns for cash trades to $+ 1 0$ days become statistically lower than 0 with beta-adjustment. The seemingly larger impact of beta adjustment on cash flows is in part due to the larger variability of this small subset, reflected in the standard errors. Also, we notice that cash flows tend to be placed on stronger prior momentum than other metaorders (46 vs 12 bps). After beta adjustment, prior momentum is not as significant and becomes very similar between cash flows and other metaorders (10 vs 11 bps).

Another element of the analysis is post-reversion impact adjustments of follow-up trades. We show the results without these adjustments in Appendix B. Using unadjusted prices and excluding cash flows, the post-reversion return is slightly higher than the implementation shortfall. The difference matches the estimated impact of additional trades in the same direction. This finding is not in contradiction with market efficiency which imposes breakeven on average: the liquidity provider makes a profit when dealing with cash flows, counter-balancing the losses incurred when providing liquidity to metaorders that are later followed by additional trades in the same direction. If we consider the mark-to-market P&L of liquidity providers after reversion counting both cash flows and other trades, we cannot exclude the null hypothesis with or without impact adjustments.

# 3.2 Fair Pricing

The fair pricing condition states that the expected return after reversion must be equal to the implementation shortfall for every metaorder size. This is a much stronger condition than breakeven. This section is dedicated to its empirical testing.

Table 3: Beta-adjusted shortfall, peak impact and returns from arrival to market close (bps). The fair pricing condition cannot be rejected after a reversion time equal to the maximum trade duration in each duration bin. Bootstrapped standard errors are in parentheses. \* Denotes significance at the 5 percent level or better.

Table 3 breaks down the beta-adjusted returns analysis of Table 2b into four duration bins for all trades excluding cash flows. The results with metaorder duration breakdown for Table 2a and for cash flows are included in Appendix A. The results show that all trades excluding cash flows that take longer to execute also require a greater amount of time for reversion. For the smallest trades, fair pricing cannot be rejected at the next day market close. For trades that complete in $1 / 2$ to 2 days, we can’t reject the null of fair pricing at the close on $^ { \dag + 2 }$ or higher. For trades that require between 2 and 5 days to execute, returns to $^ { \dag + 2 }$ still exceed the shortfall by more than 7 basis points at $^ { \dag + 2 }$ but this difference is not statistically significant due to the smaller sample size of longer trades and larger standard error. Suggesting further reversion, returns to ${ \mathsf { T } } { + } 5$ are lower and closest to the shortfall. Similarly, for trades longer than 5 days, returns to $\top + 2$ and ${ \mathsf { T } } { + } 5$ exceed shortfall by 18.78 and 10.43 bps, respectively, but the differences are not statistically significant; returns to $\mathtt { T } + 1 0$ are the closest to shortfall. Our results on reversion support fair pricing for all trade durations, but we also cannot reject the $\epsilon$ -intelligence prediction of $2 5 \%$ reversion.

Figure 1: Beta-adjusted returns from trade start, by trade duration and purpose. Reversion time takes the same number of days to complete as the duration of the metaorder. The average shortfall and peak impact of cash flows are similar to the average for other metaorders of short duration, but the returns after trade completion are markedly different. Impact reverts completely after cash flows, whereas each other group only reverts back to a level similar to the shortfall (first point from the left), consistent with fair pricing.

Figure 1 illustrates the results of Table 3 and also includes the overall average for cash flows as shown in Table 2b. Reversion after the trade is completed is more pronounced for cash flows than other trades. By five days after trade completion, cash flows have experienced full reversion, i.e. the impact has been completely erased and the realized shortfall stands as a mark-to-market portfolio loss. Returns for cash flows to $+ 1 0$ days become statistically lower than 0 with beta adjustment, at -13bps with a standard error of 4. Greater than $100 \%$ reversion can occur for example if a cash flow trade follows similar trades at other firms, in which case the subsequent reversion erases not only the impact of this trade but also the combined impact of prior cash flows . The more-than-complete reversion is reminiscent of Coval and Stafford (2007) who found that forced sales were followed by more than $100 \%$ reversion.

Figure 2: Fair pricing. We show beta-adjusted returns from arrival by trade difficulty for all metaorders excluding cash flows. The fair pricing assumption is verified for each trade difficulty: the beta-adjusted implementation

shortfall (blue line) matches permanent impact as measured by the signed beta-adjusted return from trade start to the post-reversion price. Reversion is assumed to complete after the same number of days as the duration of the metaorder. The fine dashed line diagonal represents the expected shortfall according to model (2). Error bars are bootstrapped standard errors of the difference between adjusted shortfall and post-reversion returns.

Figure 2 shows the average beta-adjusted returns from arrival for all metaorders excluding cash flows, grouped by trade difficulty which is measured as the estimated impact as defined in (2). We compare average beta-adjusted shortfall to the beta-adjusted returns from arrival up to the end of the reversion time. According to the findings at the top of this section, we will consider the relevant reversion benchmark as a function of trade duration. For trades shorter than a half day we will take the next day close as the relevant post-reversion benchmark. For trades with execution times between half a day and two trading days we take the market close at the end of the second day after the last fill. For trades between 2 and 5 days long and more the 5 days long we take, respectively, the market close at $^ { \dag + 5 }$ and $\tan \mathtt { 1 0 }$ . The results show that fair pricing holds consistently across all ranges of trade difficulty since there are no significant differences between the average shortfall and the returns to the reversion price.

In the empirical analysis we used bootstrapped standard errors to avoid relying on the Gaussian assumption, which can underestimate uncertainty in financial data due to tail effects. Even bootstrapped standard errors can underestimate uncertainty due to the heterogeneity in stocks or the presence of persistent market “modes”. For example, markets can exhibit persistent structure over an extended bull market or in a persistent range-bound market. To address these issues, in Appendix C we include analyses by random bins, quarter, metaorder size and liquidity. The results show that break even on a beta-adjusted basis still holds separately for every data subgroup.

In Appendix B, we reproduce Figure 2 without adjusting prices in the reversion period for the impact of orders in the same security that are not part of the same metaorder. Excluding cash flows, mid-sized metaorders show a small but significant mark-to-market profit after reversion, due to a bias where continuing trades are more likely to be in the same direction than opposite to a metaorder. If we consider all metaorders without excluding cash flows, we cannot exclude fair pricing.

# 4. Deviations from Fair Pricing

FGLW derives the fair pricing condition from a Nash equilibrium in a model where portfolio managers compete to exploit a shared information signal. If such a competitive equilibrium is responsible for the equivalence between shortfall and permanent impact, then one would not expect the argument to apply to cash flows, which have no information signal. So there would be no reason to believe that fair pricing should hold in that case, and indeed as we have seen it does not. In Figure 3 we illustrate the failure of fair pricing for cash flows as a function of trade difficulty. The impact of cash flows tends to revert completely for all trade difficulty bins except those in the range between 30 and 60 bps of trade difficulty. Even for that bin, reversion more than compensates for average shortfall by a large extent so we can conclude cash flow trades have little to no permanent impact on average. The same conclusions hold if one doesn’t adjust for the impact of continuing trades.

![](images/be4d91dddd85e45dd1d8a9f4783420f325884d35fb859120c17583189aa2a50f.jpg)  
Figure 3: Returns from arrival by trade difficulty for cash flows. The impact of cash flow trades reverts completely for trade difficulties below 25bps and above 70bps.For intermediate trade difficulties approximately half of the implementation shortfall is lost after reversion. The dashed diagonal line is the expected shortfall according to model (2). Error bars are bootstrapped standard errors of the difference between adjusted shortfall and postreversion returns.

Fair pricing is a property of the average non-cash-flow metaorder. Specific subsets of metaorders may violate fair pricing leading to either gains or losses to the liquidity providers. In Table 4 we describe how metaorder and stock characteristics correlate with the unrealized beta-adjusted P&L of the liquidity providers at the time reversion is complete. The beta-adjusted $\mathsf { P } / ( \mathsf { L } )$ is measured as the difference between the beta-adjusted shortfall and beta-adjusted return from arrival to the reversion price. Following on our analysis in the previous section, we set the reversion price as the $\mathsf { T } { + } 1$ close for trades that take up to half a day to execute, $\top + 2$ close for trades that require between half a day and two days to complete, ${ \mathsf { T } } { + } { 5 }$ close for trades that take more than two days but no more than five days, and $\mathtt { T } + 1 0$ close for the longest trades.

The set of regressors includes the square root of size relative to ADV, volatility and spread, and the betaadjusted momentum between the market open and start of execution of the metaorder. We also include indicator variables for trades in stocks of large and mid capitalization, buys, Nasdaq stocks and the cases where the metaorder was aggregated across multiple portfolio managers executing through the same trading desk. The regression also includes trade origination type, defined by comparing the metaorder with prior orders by the same firm within the last three months. New trades are cases where there was no prior metaorder from the same portfolio manager within the last 3 months; profit taking trades are reversals of prior decisions at a profitable price, whereas price improvement trades are trades that add to a prior decision at lower price for a buy, or higher price for a sell. The remaining cases are collinear. The coefficient estimates with respect to each regressor represent its impact on the P/(L) after adjusting for all other variables: a positive value means that the variable is associated with a profit for liquidity providers, whereas a negative value implies a loss.

The regression for cash flows shows that larger gains are associated with larger trade sizes, reflecting stronger reversion for these metaorders.

Except for cash flows, trade size is not a significant determinant of deviations from fair pricing. Metaorders from multiple portfolio managers are more likely to be associated with a negative $\mathsf { P } / ( \mathsf { L } )$ for the liquidity provider. While our data doesn't disclose the specific mechanism that would result in multiple portfolio managers building or unwinding positions concurrently, internal analyst signals are shared with all portfolio managers whereas in other cases metaorders represent the views of an individual manager. Yet another type of metaorder origination is a response to third party research reports. In these cases the metaorders are most likely to be contemporaneous with trades from portfolio managers at other firms, which would imply that the aggregate metaorder size counting all firms would be larger than what is observed here.

Our results also show that Nasdaq remains a significant negative factor of the mark-to-market P&L of liquidity providers even after controlling for size. Similar results have been found in numerous studies (see Bessembinder, 1999; Huang and Stoll, 1996; Chan and Lakonishok, 1997; Conrad et al. 2003; Obizhaeva, 2007). This could be explained by the fact that NYSE specialists operate in centralized markets and are better informed about the current situation in their stocks, corroborating the theory that information reflects on permanent market impact.

Prior momentum is a positive driver of the liquidity provider P/(L), possibly representing a continuation of an aggregate metaorder that started with other firms not included within our dataset. In this case, it is possible that the later arrival in our dataset takes a loss after reversion while the $\mathsf { P } / ( \mathsf { L } )$ on the aggregate metaorder is zero. In metaorders that aggregate interests from multiple firms, the first firms to respond to a signal make a mark-to-market profit while the last ones to join into the metaorder will incur a loss.

Table 4: Regression analysis for the beta-adjusted P&L of liquidity providers. Bootstrapped standard errors in parentheses. \* Denotes significance at the 5 percent level or better. Metaorders aggregated across multiple portfolio managers, new trades and trades in Nasdaq-listed names are significant positive drivers of mark-tomarket P&L at the final reversion price, reflecting the fact that these metaorders are more likely to be more informed than average leaving a profit for the portfolio manager. Vice-versa, the liquidity provider is more likely to make a profit when dealing against metaorders that seek to improve the portfolio manager's average price by adding to a prior decision, are in large cap stocks, or follow prior momentum.

Price improvement trades are more profitable for the liquidity provider. New trades and profit-taking trades tend to be profitable for the portfolio manager although the latter is not significant. Priceimproving trades are profitable for the liquidity provider. Volatility is not a significant predictor of deviations from fair pricing.

In Figure 4 we consider fair pricing by portfolio manager. We label metaorders that aggregate several orders with the portfolio manager that placed the first order in the aggregate and then take the 20 portfolio managers that appear most frequently. There are a few significant deviations from fair pricing. At the right of the figure, a small-cap portfolio manager has higher-than-average shortfalls and even higher permanent impact. The lowest shortfall at the left of the chart corresponds to a manager with an average negative mark-to-market P&L. Upon further investigation we found that that the desk executes these metaorders with limits and the residuals are dropped at the end of the trading day. The portfolio is re-optimized daily, so a new trading list is generated each day. The metaorders that only filled a small number of shares due to the limits and strong short-term information were dropped due to our size filter.

# 5. Shape and scale of the impact function for cash flows vs other metaorders

In this section we will test the square root shape of implementation shortfall as a function of trade size, and measure the scaling factor for market impact separately for cash flows and other metaorders.

If shortfall is an exponent of trade size $E ( s h o r t f a l l ) \sim Q ^ { \beta - 1 }$ , the ratio of peak impact to implementation shortfall should be constant and related to the size exponent as:

$$
{ \frac { Q ^ { \beta - 1 } } { { \frac { 1 } { Q } } \int _ { 0 } ^ { Q } q ^ { \beta - 1 } d q } } = \beta
$$

To test this prediction we measure peak impact as the signed return from the midpoint price at the beginning of the metaorder to the midpoint price at the end of the metaorder (last fill). Figure 5 shows the peak impact as a function of expected shortfall according to the square root model (2), for cash flows and other metaorders separately. The theoretical prediction for $\beta = 1 . 5$ , ???????? ???????? $z t = 1 . 5 \ \times$ $E ( s h o r t f a l l ) $ , is shown as a dashed line. The data is binned in such a way that each bin contains at least 200 points for cash flows and at least 600 points/bin for other metaorders; standard errors for each bin are shown for the cash flows. The peak impact of cash flows is statistically indistinguishable from that of other metaorders and both are indistinguishable from 1.5 times the estimated shortfall.

Figure 5: Shape of market impact for cash flows and other trades. We show peak impact as a function of estimated shortfall according to the square root model, for cash flows and other trades. Peak impact is the midpoint return from start to end of trading signed by the metaorder. We cannot reject the hypothesis that impact is the same for cash flows as for other metaorders, or the hypothesis that peak impact is 1.5 times the estimated average impact.

The slope 1.5 in Figure 5 is consistent with a square root shape for the impact function; more detailed analysis reveals that our data does not enable us to reject slightly different exponents, such as those found in the $\epsilon$ -intelligence model which predicts a higher degree of concavity for high participation rates and more linear impact for very slow executions.

# 6. Discussion

We empirically studied the market impact of metaorders that aggregate near-overlapping interests from portfolio managers by asset management firm, security and side. We found that the post-trade reversion process takes place over the same amount of time as is required to execute the trade. Cash flows revert completely, confirming the view that permanent impact is related to the information content of a metaorder. For other trades we find that, on average for every metaorder size, permanent impact equals implementation shortfall. We considered the mark-to-market P&L of metaorders at the reversion price, conditioned on variables correlated with information available to portfolio managers. We find classes of institutional trades that drive systematic AUM gains while others cause systematic losses after reversion. Trades in Nasdaq listed names and new trades in stocks where the portfolio manager has not been active in the last 3 months tend to be profitable after reversion. Priceimprovement trades, trades in large-cap stocks and trades initiated after strong intraday momentum are associated with losses.

The concept that the average permanent impact must equal the expected information of a trade is rooted in economic logic: markets digest publicly available information, and through efficient competition, enforce the Martingale property that price after trade completion must be the expected future price given all information available at that time. Our observations generalize that of Glosten and Milgrom (1985) that the price after a single transaction is the expected future price conditioned on the fact that the transaction took place. In our case we are dealing with metaorder executions that are executed over time, but as in Glosten and Milgrom our observations suggest that the expected price after reversion is a measure of the information that originated the metaorder.

We also find that both expected shortfall and permanent impact scale as a square root of the metaorder size. These relationships between impact, information and metaorder size bring up an interesting question: how do portfolio managers know how to measure the information in their signals in a manner that enables them to set the right order sizes?

Farmer et al. (2013) propose that metaorder sizes are set according to a competitive equilibrium where portfolio managers seek to exploit a shared information signal. This does not quite remove the mystery of how portfolio managers come to know the amount of information in their signals, but spreads the burden of such knowledge to a crowd of portfolio managers who only need to come up with the right answer collectively. The ability of agents to collectively arrive at an accurate answer through averaging is illustrated through many other surprising examples in Surowiecki's bestseller "The Wisdom of The Crowds" (Surowiecki 2005).

During the execution process itself, we find that the market hardly distinguishes between cash flows and other trades. This explains the success of mechanical models of market impact, such as the $\epsilon$ - intelligence model, at reproducing many of the observed properties of market impact, including its concave shape and price reversion. As stated in Bouchaud et al. (2004), "Since trading on modern electronic markets is anonymous, there cannot be any obvious difference between 'informed' and 'uninformed' metaorders. Hence, the impact of any metaorder must statistically be the same, whether informed or not informed. Impact is necessary for private information to be reflected in prices, but by the same token, random fluctuations in order flow must necessarily contribute to the volatility of markets." This reasoning is consistent with the observation that the impact of cash flows is similar in scale and shape as other trades. But the complete reversion of market impact for cash flow trades also implies that permanent impact cannot be modeled without considering information.

How does the market transition from being unable to discern informed from uninformed trades during the execution, to producing different reversion trajectories after the metaorder is finished? To answer this question we consider the ecology of models that aim to model a stock's price and trade on perceived mispricings. These have different designs; models can use fundamental or technical information, they can aim to predict discounted future dividend payouts, free cash flows or revenues. They can be designed by analysts or trained using machine learning. We will refer to them here collectively as fair price models. Fair price models capture the dependencies of stock prices on factors like prices of related stocks, interest rates, input costs, currencies, etc. Drivers are updated when news impacts expectations, for example following earnings announcements; in absence of news there is no reason to modify the drivers and therefore fair price should change only to track the fluctuations in correlated assets. If a metaorder is uninformed one expects the parameters of fair price models to remain unaltered, trading firms using these models to place orders will drive expected price back towards the original fair value. If on the other hand the metaorder was created in response to a source of news, analysis or report, or indeed from a fair price model itself, then it is natural to expect at least some of the other fair price models to adjust their parameters to account for the information that spawned the metaorder. The metaorders studied in our paper are large (at least $1 \%$ of daily volume) and aggressively executed (approximately $10 \%$ of volume on average). It seems reasonable to assume that the expected net effect of fair price models is comparatively much smaller. Therefore during the execution process the order imbalance caused by the metaorder will dominate the short-term information stream and cause similar impacts for informed trades as for cash flows. After the metaorder has finished, the market is left to observe the net effect of fair price models, driving differential reversion for cash flows vs other trades. A more detailed study of the response of fair price models to a metaorder shock lies beyond the scope of this paper, but seems potentially quite rewarding in understanding the mechanisms through which our markets set prices.

One of the more controversial observations is that permanent impact scales as a square root of trade size, or rather, that portfolio managers create metaorders proportional to the square of information. This prediction is consistent with the model of Gabaix et al. (2006) but conflicts with arguments that permanent impact must be a linear function of trade size. These include the non-manipulation argument of (Huberman and Stanzl, 2004), the no dynamic arbitrage principle of (Gatheral, J. 2010), and in the context of insider information, Kyle (1985). We will discuss the insider trading model first and then address price manipulation and no arbitrage arguments.

Kyle considers a game where the insider knows information that will be publicly announced at given time, and shows that the informed trader in this situation will act linearly. Since the final price is known to the insider she does not trade beyond that price, so price reaches the informed level at the end of the period and there is no reversion. The situation we consider in this paper differs in two crucial aspects: (1) our data represents metaorders with varying durations, so liquidity providers interacting with these metaorders cannot know when a metaorder will end. When the end of a metaorder is observed, price adjusts to remove expectations of future order flows. Since impact is related to expectations of future order flows, the distribution of order sizes sets the shape of the impact function. (2) Informed traders in our study are not insiders. Rather, they react to information that is available to others and join other portfolio managers in a metaorder. This lack of inside information can be evidenced in the result that metaorders in our data are not profitable after reversion, in contrast with the situation envisioned by Kyle where insiders have a monopoly on information and therefore can make systematic profits at the expense of noise traders.

Non-manipulation (Huberman and Stanzl, 2004) and no dynamic arbitrage (Gatheral 2010) arguments show that mechanical permanent impact must be linear. The basic idea is that if random trades have permanent impact then for a non-linear impact function it would be possible to manipulate prices or make profits through round trip trades. To take an example, if permanent impact is a square root of trade size then one can buy N/k through k separate orders, causing a total permanent impact of $k \sqrt { \frac { N } { k } } ,$ then sell the entire position in one order for N shares. The net permanent impact in this case would be $k \sqrt { \frac { N } { k } } - \sqrt { N } = \bigl ( \sqrt { k } - 1 \bigr ) N$ . The cost of the buys relative to the starting price is $\begin{array} { r } { \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { k } i \sqrt { \frac { N } { k } } = } \end{array}$ $\frac { k ( k + 1 ) } { 2 } \sqrt { \frac { N } { k } }$ whereas the price obtained for the sales relative to the starting price is $k \sqrt { \frac { N } { k } } - \sqrt { k N } = 0$ . In this example price manipulation would be effective but incur a net cost. However, our study showed that uninformed trades have no permanent impact. Price manipulation trades by design are uninformed, so they cannot be used to permanently alter prices.

If the institutional trade sizes are rooted in information, the relationship between "excess volatility" and institutional trades described by Gabaix et al. (2006) are correct but perhaps best laid out in the opposite causal order: it is not that institutional trades cause heavy-tailed returns, but rather, that a heavy tail in information shocks causes a heavy tail in the distribution of metaorder sizes. Large metaorders can occur either because a single portfolio manager places larger orders in presence of a strong information signal, or because a larger number of portfolio managers join a metaorder, or both. Evidence for information driving large metaorders can be found for example in the high trading volumes accompanying surprises in earnings announcements.

Our results are consistent with the findings of other authors. Long reversion times have also been observed in previous empirical studies in single trades that observe reversion up to the next trading day (Biais et al. 1995, Bouchaud et al. 2004). Aggregated trades are larger trades and hence require a longer time for reversion (Chan and Lakonishok 1995, 1997), (Moro et al. 2009). Bershova and Rakhlin (2013) also find that permanent impact is not significantly different from the implementation shortfall and 2/3 of peak impact.

While fair pricing at first glance seems harmless to portfolio managers since mark-to-market P&L is zero on average, in reality one should consider liquidation values instead of the mark-to-market values of positions. If an informed buy satisfying fair pricing is followed by an equally informed sell, the net result is a loss to AUM $\$ 5$ equal to the implementation shortfall on the sell leg. The fair pricing equilibrium is reminiscent of the tragedy of the commons (Hardin, 1968), in the sense that the short-term value of information signals to the portfolio manager community is destroyed through overtrading. Our study did not consider longer-term returns, it is of course possible that informed trades that initially satisfy the fair pricing condition would later turn out to be profitable over the portfolio holding period.

# Appendix A

Table 5 breaks down the analysis of Table 2b into four duration bins for cash flow trades. For all duration bins, we observe that post-trade price reversion outweighs the peak impact between first and last fills. The difference between the beta-adjusted returns to market close benchmarks and the observed shortfall is statistically significant for the larger subsets with trades of shorter duration. The subsets for trades with durations between 2 and 5 days and more than 5 days do not show statistically significant results due to large standard errors and small sample sizes. Table 6 shows the same analysis for returns without beta adjustments. The results on statistical significance and conclusions are virtually the same. The one exception is for the longest trades excluding cash flows, where returns to market close to $^ { \dag + 2 }$ are still significantly larger than shortfall. Still, as in the case with beta adjustments, returns to $\tan \mathtt { 1 0 }$ are the closest to the shortfall.

# Appendix B

Our empirical analysis is based on post-trade returns adjusted for the impact of subsequent metaorders by the same firm in the same stock that occur with a gap greater than 60 minutes for different portfolio managers, or after at least a full day pause for the same manager. We believe this is the appropriate method to reduce the bias in the relationship between trade duration and market impact when portfolio managers are more likely to increase their positions in stocks that have come down further, or sell more when a stock continues to rise. To assess the effect of the post-trade impact adjustment on our findings, we show in Tables 7a, b the results on returns from arrival without these adjustments. Figure 9 shows the results on fair pricing. There is an apparent profit for metaorders excluding cash trades that can be explained by the impact of continuing trades in the same direction. Continuing trades are more common than reversals (selling a stock that the firm recently bought) and are more likely to occur following price improvement. If we include all metaorders without excluding cash flows, we cannot reject fair pricing.

Shortfall, peak impact and returns to the market close after the trade is completed are shown both in terms of absolute returns (top) and in terms of beta-adjusted returns (bottom). Bootstrapped standard errors are in parenthesis. \* Denotes significance at the 5 percent level or better. The results show that cash flow trades represent a loss for firms whereas other trades are associated with a profit.

Figure 9. Fair pricing without impact adjustments. Beta-adjusted returns are shown as a function of expected shortfall without adjusting for the impact of subsequent trades by the same firm in the same stock. The dotted line shows the stock return after reversion; the continuous line is the implementation shortfall. Medium-sized metaorders have a slight positive P&L due to follow-on trades in the same direction but we cannot exclude the null that implementation shortfall is equal to permanent impact.

# Appendix C

Standard errors can underestimate the uncertainty in financial variables due to tail effects and temporal structure such as bull markets or mean-reverting periods. In our analysis, we addressed the effect of market drift by defining fair pricing in terms of beta-adjusted returns instead of absolute returns. We used bootstrapped standard errors to avoid assumptions on the shape of the underlying distribution. In this section, we test the fair pricing condition further by splitting the data by random deciles, by quarter, by volume and by trade size. The results show that we cannot reject breakeven in any of 10 bins in a random partitioning of the data (Figure 10) or by quarter (Figure 11). Using quarterly bins reveals a downward trend in both shortfalls and permanent impact tracking the decline in market volatility following the US mortgage crisis.

Figure 11: Shortfall and permanent impact by quarter. We cannot reject breakeven in any quarter. The downward

slope of both shortfall and permanent impact reflect declining market volatility following the US 2008 mortgage crisis.

In Figure 12a,b we consider shortfall and permanent impact by deciles of traded volume from start to end of the metaorder. Traded volume is normalized to a daily value by multiplying by $\frac { 3 9 0 } { t } ,$ ,where $t$ is the trade duration in minutes. Figure 12a shows the results for small trades, comprising less than $5 \%$ of average daily volume (ADV) in the stock. Figure 12b shows the case of large trades which exceed $5 \%$ of the ADV. We cannot reject fair pricing in any of the 20 cases by volume and trade size.

Shortfall and Permanent Impact by Volume Large Trades Excluding Cash Flows

Figure 12a, b: Shortfall and permanent impact by volume and trade size. We explore fair pricing in deciles of contemporaneous trade volume normalized to a daily value by splitting the data into two sets by trade size. The metaorders are classified as “large” or “small” according to whether the number of shares is greater or lesser than $5 \%$ of the average daily volume in the stock.

Table 8 shows the average and standard deviation of the market makers’ P&L for each partition of the data. Splitting the data by quarter produces the highest standard deviation (7.74). This shows that temporal coherence increases error bars on the unrealized P&L after reversion by roughly a factor of 2.

# Appendix D

In fair pricing theory, the shape of the impact function is determined by market participants' expectations regarding the likelihood that a metaorder will continue or stop. Because of this, the tail behavior of the size distribution determines the scaling exponent $\delta$ for impact as a function of trade size. In this section we attempt to determine the distributions of trade durations and trade sizes. In order to estimate the tail exponents accurately we removed the $5 i z e { > } 1 \%$ ADV filter. We find that trade durations are consistent with a Pareto distribution with a tail exponent $\zeta _ { T } = 1 . 8$ for durations of at least one whole day (Figure 13). This is higher than the exponent 1.3 found by Vaglica et al. (2008) who consider patches of directional trading by brokers on three stocks in Spain's BME.

Figure 13: Distribution of trade durations. The probability density function of trade durations in minutes falls off as a power law with exponent 2.8 (exponent 1.8 for the cumulative distribution). Spikes at multiples of 390 minutes reflect a preference to start trades at the market open and end trades at the market close.

To analyze the distribution of trade sizes, we normalized traded quantity by the average daily volume (ADV) to enable comparison across stocks with different market volumes. The ADV is defined as the 30- day trailing average of regular market hours volume. We find the size distribution is consistent with a tail exponent $\beta = 1 . 5$ (Figure14). In Figure 15, we show the distribution of trade sizes for cash flows only. Cash flow trades are consistent with a log-normal over the range from $0 . 0 1 \%$ to $70 \%$ of ADV.

Figure 14: Trade size distribution excluding cash flows. The distribution of trade sizes normalized to Average Daily

Volume (ADV) fits a power-law decay with $\beta = 1 . 5$ , extending up to metaorders of ${ 5 \mathord { - } 1 0 \times }$ daily volume.

Figure 15: Trade size distribution for cash flows. The size distribution of cash flow trades does not support the tail exponent 1.5 found for metaorders overall; cash flows are well-modeled by a log-normal distribution over the entire range of sizes in our sample.

The distribution of trade sizes in shares is shown in Figure 16. The tail exponent is lower than that of normalized trade sizes due to the larger number of stocks with a low ADV.

Figure 16: Trade size distribution in shares filled. The distribution of trade sizes in shares doesn't fit either the lognormal or the Pareto distribution. We show a slope -2 (Cauchy distribution) for illustration purposes.

There are several prior results in the literature regarding the tail exponent of the metaorder distribution. The auto-correlation function of transaction signs in cash equity markets decays as $C ( \tau ) \sim \tau ^ { - \gamma }$ where $\gamma \approx 0 . 5$ (Lillo et al. 2005). These authors show that under a simple theory of order splitting, the autocorrelation in order flow can be shown to follow from a fat-tailed metaorder distribution with tail exponent $\beta = \gamma + 1$ . The size of banks (Pushkin and Aref, 2004) follow Zipf's law, i.e. the cumulative probability that assets under management be greater than $x$ decays as $1 / x$ . Using this result and the square root form of the impact function, Gabaix et al. (2006) predict a tail exponent $3 / 2$ consistent to our result. Note however that different order creators may follow different size distributions. For example, Schwarzkopf and Farmer (2010) showed that mutual fund sizes follow a log normal distribution. Vaglica et al. (2008) find an exponent 1.7 using brokerage data. They showed that the size distribution of metaorders from a single source should be expected to be log-normal (once sizes are normalized by daily volume to enable comparison across stocks) and that the fat-tailed size distribution in brokerage data is an effect of the aggregation of data from many firms of different sizes.

Our sample of portfolio managers is dominated by a few very large firms and as such does not represent an unbiased sampling of firm sizes.
